Dogs	  Water, foam, sand, blankets, and even baking soda are well-known solutions to putting out flames. But sound waves? That has to be a first. But that is exactly what two young engineers from George Mason University are using to douse small fires. Electrical and computer engineering students Viet Tran and Seth Robertson were looking for an interesting idea for their senior research project. Thats when they stumbled upon an experiment conducted by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA ) in 2012. Called acoustic suppression of flame it was abandoned after the agency was unable to determine its effectiveness on a large scale. Tran and Robertson decided to challenge themselves and see if they could take the research to the next level and build a fire extinguisher that could be used commercially. As with any radical idea, they faced a lot of skepticism even from faculty members many of whom declined to serve as advisors. After all, neither of the students were chemical engineers so what could they possibly know about creating a fire extinguisher? The students were finally able to convince Professor Brian Mark who agreed to oversee the project and not fail them, if they were unable to make the concept work. The young engineers first tried to extinguish the fire by placing a subwoofer near a flame created using rubbing alcohol. But they soon realized that music is not such a good idea since it is inconsistent and unpredictable. The next option was exposing the fire to 20,000 to 30,000 hertz frequencies. However with the high frequencies, the flames only vibrated. The duo hit a home run when they reduced the frequency to about 30 to 60 hertz. Turns out that at these low frequencies, the sound vibrates the oxygen away from the flames. With no fuel to keep them going, the fire suffocates and dies. The 20 lbs prototype that looks like an antique milk can is connected to a well-ventilated amp. A bass speaker fixed above the barrel amplifies and directs the sound waves. While it can currently put out only small alcohol-fueled fires, the students hope to make it work for other flammable chemicals as well. Also, although Tran and Robertson had initially envisioned the handheld extinguisher to be for home or space use, they now believe it could even work for larger fires. A local fire department has already shown interest in testing the extinguisher on a structure fire, in the hopes of replacing toxic and messy chemicals with clean sound waves! Though the young students appear to have convinced many of the initial skeptics, Kenneth E Isman, a clinical professor at the University of Marylands fire-protection engineering department, is not amongst them. He believes that while the extinguisher may be good enough to put out small pan fires, it will not be able to deal with larger domestic fires. He is also concerned that the sound waves do not cool the flames down. This means that the minute they get exposed to oxygen they could easily rekindle. However, Tran and Robertson are not letting naysayers stray them from their goal. They are forging ahead with their idea, this time with the full support of the University who is even helping them apply for a provisional patent. If they do succeed, there may be soon be a time when fire trucks will be extinguishing flames with some sweet music, instead of messy toxic chemicals! 
Dogs	 Over the past few years, researchers have come up with many innovative ways to use human kinetic energy - from powering soccer fields to playgrounds and classroom lights. Now some scientists want to take it to the next level with a new fabric that harnesses everyday motion to power personal devices! The brainchild of a team of scientists from South Koreas Sungkyunkwan University and Australias University of Wollongong, the electricity producing fabric takes advantage of the Triboelectric effect (TNG). Also known as friction energy it is the electricity created when two different kinds of surfaces rub against one another. While this sounds complicated, it is something we have all encountered. Remember the age-old trick of rubbing your head on a balloon to make your hair stand up? That is the triboelectric effect. As the surfaces rub together, the electrons move from one surface to the other. This leaves one object negatively charged (balloon) and the other positively charged (hair). Since opposites attract, the electrons in the hair leap toward the balloon causing it to stand up. To create the wearable triboelectric nanogenerator (WTNG), the researchers first layered the upper and lower side of the fabric with silver. They then inserted a polymer sheet covered with zinc oxide between the two. When the person wearing the clothing moves, the minuscule zinc-oxide rods rub against the silver coated cloth creating friction energy. The polymer picks up the electrons moving from one layer to another and uses the electricity generated to charge the electrical gizmos embedded in the clothing. In trials, the scientists were able to power a small screen, some LED lights, and a keyless car remote control. Not surprisingly, multiple layers of WTNG were more effective at generating electricity than a single layer. What is impressive is that the material can capture energy from even the smallest of movements. This means that a user does not need to run a marathon for the technology to be effective. This is not the first attempt at creating TNG wearables. However, past renditions have been unsuccessful due to the short battery life and because the materials were stiff and therefore uncomfortable to wear. The WNTG not only eliminates the need for batteries, but also looks and feels like a regular fabric. Another issue was that repeated wear or a trip to the laundry machine would wash away the silver and zinc coating. The researchers solved this problem by covering the layers with a thin film of plastic. In their laboratory trials they were able to use the fabric for more than 12,000 cycles. Sang-Woo Kim and this team who reported their invention in the March ACS journal say that the fabrics use goes beyond charging personal devices. They believe it could also be useful in a range of biomedical and other personal healthcare gizmos that need a reliable power source. 
Dogs	 Environmentalists use different tactics to raise public awareness. Some organize rallies, others set up petitions, and then there is Lewis Gordon Pugh. This activist and adventurer highlights the planets woes by swimming in the vulnerable ecosystems of some of the worlds coldest waters. If that sends a chill down your spine, consider this - the activist swims wearing only a Speedo swimsuit! His past endeavors include being the first human to swim in the Arctic - a feat that earned him the nickname of human polar bear. In 2010, Pugh took the plunge into the Khumbu Glacier Lake on the slopes of the Himalayas to draw attention to the mountains rapidly melting glaciers. However, his latest adventure in the southernmost part of the planet is the most difficult and dangerous one he has undertaken thus far. From February 13 to March 7, Pugh conducted a series of five swims in Antarcticas Ross Sea. During each of the swims that were spread over three weeks, Pugh spent about 20 minutes in water temperatures as low as minus 1.7C (28.94F), just 0.3C shy of the freezing point of salt water. While that may not seem like much, Pugh says that any additional time spent in water this cold would kill him. If that wasnt bad enough, he also had to watch out for the aggressive Leopard seals and killer sharks, that inhabit the freezing waters. Fortunately, besides chased down by an overzealous seal, Pugh emerged relatively unscathed. While the swims did help Pugh establish yet another record for being the first to swim in the most southerly part of the planet, that was not the reason he pursued the life-threatening mission. The 45-year-old hopes that his swims will persuade the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) to set aside a marine protection area the size of UK, Germany and France in the Ross Sea. Home to the Antarctic Toothfish, the Colossal Squid, and the Emperor Penguin, it is currently one of the most pristine areas in the world. While there has been some commercial fishing in the region since the 1990s, the ecosystem has yet to be affected. Pugh hopes that he can convince the officials to put a protection order in place, before that changes. The activist realizes his stunt may not convince the members of CCAMLR which consists of representatives from 24 countries and the European Union. However, it will not be for lack of trying and that, is all Pugh can do! The British endurance swimmer who also happens to be a marine lawyer has not always been an activist. Inspired by explorers like Roald Amundsen (first person to traverse the Antarctica) and Edmund Hillary (first person to climb Mt. Everest), Pugh decided to become a pioneer swimmer. However, as he was trying to fulfill his quest to be first to swim across all seven oceans, he experienced firsthand, the effects of global warming. The alarming rate at which he observed glaciers melting and animals disappearing, transformed him into one of the worlds most passionate ocean advocates. As to how he manages to endure the freezing waters? In addition to training in frozen pools and putting on some weight (have you seen a cold whale?), Pugh also uses a swim technique that is unique to him. Called anticipatory thermogenesis, it is the ability to raise his body temperature from 98.6F to 103F (from 37C to 39.5C), and heart rate from 70 to 160 beats a second. This is similar to the state of a normal human following a long run, except Lewis does it with the power of his mind! Once he is hot and sweaty, he plunges in! As for the Speedo? The adventurer says, Swimming in Speedos shows commitment, courage, and integrity, and it opens doors and gives me access to world leaders! We sure hope all his hard work to save the Ross Sea pays off. 
Dogs	 At first sight, Elana Schlenkers pop-up store, Less Than 100, which was open in Pittsburgh during the month of April appeared just like any other gift store. However, when shoppers went to pay, they were in for a surprise. Thats because while men paid full price, women received a 14% discount. Though that may appear to be blatant discrimination, Elana was merely abiding by the stores slogan pay what you are paid. And since women in the US get paid an average of 76 cents for every dollar men earn for the same job, it is only fair that they pay less. As if the stores pricing policy was not enough to get the message across, Elana also distributed pamphlets. Entitled What Are Women Worth?, it explained the status of the wage gap both in Pennsylvania and across the country, and also gave women tips on how to better negotiate salaries. A 2015 study conducted by the Institute for Womens Policy Research found that although the rate of womens income has been rising, men still earn more in every state in the country. But though paying women less wages is a shame, forking out the full price at Less Than 100 wasnt necessarily a bad thing. Thats because the proceeds of all sales went directly to the local artists that had created the beautiful wares. During its month-long tenure, the shop was visited by hundreds of women who wanted to support her mission and the local artists whose work was being showcased. Some even brought in their kids and grandkids to educate them about theimportance of keeping the gender wage debate alive. Elana says that while she received some grief about the discrimination, most men were extremely gracious and happy to pay the full price. Not surprisingly, the unusual venture has drawn worldwide attention. This November, Elana will partner with photographer Tammy Mercure and open a Less than 100 pop-up store in New Orleans.She believes starting the debate in Louisiana is important given that the state boasts the nations widest gender wage disparity. Here, women earn a whopping 34 cents less than their male counterparts. While she has received several requests from California, it may be close to the bottom of her list. Thats because the Golden State is one of the most progressive when it comes to wage equality, and therefore does not need much help. Though the Less than 100 project will not resolve the wage disparity, it is a thought-provoking way to bring to the forefront an issue that is increasingly causing a lot of angst among women. Fortunately, Elana is not the only one trying to change the unfair system. Patricia Arquette made an impassioned plea for gender wage equality in her acceptance speech at the Oscars this February. Ellen Pao the interim CEO of Reddit recently announced that new employees will be forbidden from negotiating salaries. She believes that men are better negotiators then women, and therefore tend to receive higher wages! Whats encouraging is that male CEOs are also joining the fight! Earlier this month, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff launched a company wide program to address the issue. Called Women Surge it aims to eliminate all gender-based pay disparities, hire and promote more women and ensure that they are better included in meetings! With all these visionaries taking the lead, it will not be long before gender pay inequality is something we will only read about in history books! 
Dogs	 Researchers recently reported the discovery of three new species of dragons in the Andean cloud forests of Ecuador and Peru. However, dont run for cover yet, for these are not fire-breathing beasts that kidnap fair maidens and battle knights in shining armor. Instead, they are just tiny wood lizards that are often referred to as miniature dragons thanks to their close resemblance to the mythical creatures. Though giants amongst the smaller lizards that dwell in the Amazon rainforests, wood lizards measure a mere three to six inches in length. The diurnal creatures feature intricately patterned skins that help them easily blend into their lush environment. The three new species unveiled by a team of scientists led by Omar Torres-Carvajal of Ecuador in the scientific journal Zookeys on April 6th, add to the twelve already known to scientists. According to Omar, when he began researching wood lizards in 2006, only seven species of the colorful dragons had been found. In fact, scientists had concluded that they were one of the less diverse groups of South American lizards. Hence finding new ones always comes as a pleasant surprise. Whats cool is that each of the newly found miniature dragons have distinct coloring and features. Enyalioides altotambo Named after the town of Alto Tambo, Ecuador where the lizard was discovered, this reptile sports a bright green color and a thick neck. According to the researchers, both male and female lizards bear an eerie resemblance to Gronckle the toughest (and slowest)dragon in the How to Train Your Dragon movie series. Enyalioides sophiarothschildae Discovered in northern Peru, the wood lizard is greenish-black, with a distinct white patch near its throat and large scales across its spine. It was named after a donor to BIOPAT, a German nonprofit organization that funds biodiversity and conservation research. Enyalioides anisolepis Anisolepis means unequal scales in Greek. This is a fitting name for the five-inch long reptile that has scales of varying sizes on its legs, flanks and back. It also has conical spikes emerging from the back of its head. While the males are a black and green hue, the females are speckled light brown. The tiny dragons are found at altitudes of between 2,375 to 5,715 feet in northern Peru and southern Ecuador. While these are certainly amazing, there may be many more miniature and perhaps even giant dragons just waiting to be discovered in the Andean cloud forests. According to conservation group Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund, the pristine region is home to 20,000 unique plants, over 1,500 terrestrial vertebrates and thousands of amphibians and birds. We, for one, cannot wait to find out what the scientists uncover next. 
Dogs	 While the sight of an 18-ton subway car being dumped into the Atlantic Ocean may appear like an ecological disaster, it is quite the opposite. Instead of harming marine life, the sturdy steel structures submerged deep into the Atlantic Ocean transform into perfect artificial reefs that provide comfortable homes for all kinds of sea creatures. The idea of the unusual disposal method was inspired by the State of Delawares artificial reef program. Started in 1995, it entailed sinking decommissioned tankers, naval ships and tugboats to the bottom of the Atlantic. According to officials, the program was necessary because of the loose sand and silt that make it impossible for natural reefs to form. In 2001 when the New York Metropolitan Transit Department (MTA) retired a fleet of 619 Redbird subway cars, they offered them to East Coast States that wished to start a similar program. According to Mike Zacchea, the Assistant Chief Operations Officer at MTA, the decision was driven largely by the cost of recycling the large number of cars. He said that the cost of removing the asbestos from the chassis would have cost the department between $12,000 to 65,000 USD for each of the cars. In contrast, transporting and dumping them set the transit department back by a mere $8,000 USD. The State of Delaware received most of the subway cars simply because the other states were not sure of their use as an artificial reef. That, of course, changed once they saw the success of the states Redbird Reef project. By the time the MTA ended its subway replacement project in 2010, over 2,500 retired subway cars, had found a new home all the way from Delaware to Georgia. Together they form 15 underwater reefs that support the life of numerous fish and crustaceans. Prepping for what Delawares reef program manager Jeff Tinsman calls luxury condominiums for fish, did take some time. While the small amount of asbestos in the subway cars was considered safe underwater, pollutants like oil had to be removed. In addition, the cars were also stripped of the seats, straps, and wheels that are either recycled or sold. Only after the structures met the strict guidelines of the US. Environmental Protection Agency were they allowed to be dumped into the ocean. The artificial reefs are still constantly monitored and studied to ensure they dont pose any threat to the underwater sea life. Thus far, numerous sea creatures have successfully converted the carbon steel subway cars into their new homes. In many instances, the metal surfaces are covered in algae, making them almost unrecognizable. In addition to shelter, the reefs provide 400 times as much food per square foot as the natural sand bottom. The dual role that the reefs play is particularly beneficial to fish such as black sea bass, which are not fast swimmers and need help escaping from sharks and other predators. An added benefit is the economic boost it provides the various states thanks to the increase in recreational activities like scuba diving. While the success of this unusual project has been known to a few, it has recently garnered public attention thanks to Stephen Mallon, a photographer who has followed the recycling efforts for many years. His recently held exhibition entitled Patterns of Interest vividly depicts a three-year journey of subway cars from carbon steel structures to robust marine abodes. Though the subway cars program came to an end in 2010, when the MTA stopped donating, some states have continued the program using other safe manmade structures like retired Navy tankers. 
Dogs	 Though there are numerous ultramarathons, competitions that exceed running or walking the traditional 26.2 miles, very few compare to The Barkley Marathons. The annual 100-mile race that challenges participants both mentally and physically has been completed by only 14 of the 1,100 total participants in its 30-year history. To put it in perspective, that is just two more than the number of people that have walked on the moon! Held annually in Wartburg, Tennessees Frozen Head State Park, the competition that takes place in late March or early April is the brainchild of ultrarunner Gary Cantrell. The ex-elite runner says his inspiration for the race came from James Earl Ray, the man accused of assassinating Martin Luther King Jr. In 1977, Ray escaped from the Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary at the foot of Frozen Head State Park. When captured 55 hours later, he had managed to cover a distance of just 8.5 miles thanks to the treacherous terrain. Cantrell decided to raise the bar with a course that consists of a 20-mile loop that runners need to complete five times in 60 hours. In order to compete for the coveted 35-40 spots, candidates have to not only prove their fitness but also write an essay on why they should be allowed to run. Then they have to do some investigative work on where to send the application; a difficult task given that the location is a closely guarded secret. Also, the applications have to get to Cantrell at midnight on Christmas day. Even a five-minute delay could result in disqualification. Things dont get any easier for the competitors that get accepted. Thats because the course, which changes annually, is revealed the day prior to the race, making any training impossible. The only thing contestants know for sure is that it will include the Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary tunnel from where James Earl Ray escaped. The actual start time of the 100-mile race is also shrouded in mystery. Runners set up camp at the Frozen Head State Park on Friday and then wait for the sound of Cantrells conch shell which alerts them that the race will commence in an hour. Since the horn can sound anytime between midnight to noon on Saturday, they have to be alert at all times. The oddities continue even when its time to race. Instead of signaling the start of the race with a starter pistol, Cantrell opts for a lighter and cigarette. The race itself must be completed in 60 hours or less, and no more than 12 hours can be spent completing each loop. Also, while the runner can choose his/her direction during the first, second, and final 20-mile loop, the third and fourth loops have to be run in opposite directions. In addition to the treacherous terrain, contestants also have to contend with the elevation. Cantrell estimates that during the five laps, contestants will climb approximately 62,000 feet - the equivalent of climbing Mount Everest twice! And if that is not stressful enough, there are only two fixed water-refilling locations and no medical personnel available to aid those in distress. Cantrell also forbids the use of GPS tracking devices or cell phones. Instead, participants have to find their way amidst the unmarked trails using a map and compass. In order to prove they completed the course, runners have to seek out books placed along the course and tear out the pages that correspond to their race numbers. Those that fail to do so are immediately disqualified. However, if you think that all these hurdles deter participants, think again. Cantrell receives in excess of 200 applications each year, many from some of the worlds best athletes. It is no wonder that the slots are filled up within five minutes after the official opening. This year was no exception. 40 competitors, including a record nine women set out to complete this crazy race the weekend of March 28th, 2015. However, there were no winners. John Kelly, a 30-year-old electrical engineer, made it the farthest by successfully conquering three of the five loops in the given time. Others werent as lucky. One passed out on the ground after running 48 miles in 28 hours. Another was deemed lost when he failed to show up seven hours after the time limit for the race had passed. Just as a search party was being organized, he strolled in telling organizers that sheer exhaustion had caused him to take an eight-hour nap atop the mountain! Despite these horror stories, most plan to endure this mental and physical ordeal at least one more time and see if they can be amongst the few able to complete the worlds toughest race. 
Dogs	 For the casual visitor, Teller Lake in Boulder, Colorado looks like a delightful fishbowl filled with thousands of gorgeous orange, black, and white goldfish floating around. However, to the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Department they are a group of invasive species that could end up disrupting the lakes entire ecosystem if not removed soon. The problem lies in the fact that these fish are not native to the lake, which means that they have no predators. This allows them to reproduce and multiply in large numbers. In fact, park officials believe that the 3,000 - 4,000 specimens currently floating around are all a result of a few unwanted pet goldfish that were dumped into the lake. From the age of the fish, they estimate the incident occurred about three years ago. While that may appear to be the most humane thing to do, it is extremely dangerous, not to mention illegal. Thats because as this non-native species grow in numbers, they compete with the existing fish for food sources like plankton and small insects. Given that there is only a limited supply of resources, this could result in the goldfish overpowering the native fish species. In the case of Teller Lake, the officials are particularly worried that the goldfish will move downstream and affect the population of some of the endangered native species that live there. Another major cause for concern is the diseases the goldfish may be harboring. This could be fatal to the native species since they do not have the immunity to fight new illnesses. The Colorado Parks and Wildlife biologists, therefore, have no option but to extract the fish from the lake in most efficient manner. They are currently contemplating three options - draining the lake, stunning the fish with electricity or using a chemical that interferes with their respiratory system. The fish will then be sent to the local raptor rehabilitation facility and fed to injured birds of prey like eagles and osprey. This is not the first time Boulder has had to deal with unwanted goldfish. A few years ago, 2,275 specimens had to be extracted from the citys Thunderbird Lake. Of course, fish are not the only unwanted pets that get discarded. Florida has been combating an invasion of Burmese pythons since the 1980s and green iguanas since the mid-1990s. However, one of the worst cases of invasive species recorded is that of the Red Lionfish. The non-native species that was accidentally released in the Atlantic by an aquarium, is currently wreaking havoc to the Atlantic Oceans ecosystem all the way from South Florida to Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. According to experts, the best way to dispose of unwanted fish or any other animal is to get advice from the people that originally sold them the pet. They say that most owners believe they are doing the right thing by returning their exotic pet back to the wilderness. However, saving one pet often results in destroying the areas ecosystem and hurting other innocent animals. 
Dogs	 Every year, bulldogs from across the country make their way to Des Moines, Iowa to participate in Drake Universitys beautiful bulldog contest. In addition to the bragging rights that come with the title, the winner also gets to serve as the mascot of the prestigious Drake Relays - the nations second oldest track event. The event that celebrated 36 years on April 19th, is extremely popular attracting as many as 100 applicants each year. Unfortunately, only fifty lucky ones picked by lottery are allowed to participate. However, that does not mean the competition is any less intense. Every owner tries his/her best to showcase their pet by dressing them in all kinds of fun and outrageous outfits, ranging from ladybirds topirates. The dogs try to impress the judges by doing what they do best - drooling! According to the decision makers, in addition to being beautiful in the classic bulldog way with the bottom teeth sticking out, the dogs also have to be kind and gentle. Tank who was adopted from Craigslist by Des Moines resident Duane Smith in 2014, seemed to fit the bill. The two-year-old who shares a home with a Pomeranian and some turtles, first impressed the judges with his no-nonsense camouflaged outfit and military-style helmet. However, what appeared to seal the deal was his au natural look during the final round. As one of the judges succinctly put it, Tank just had a great look to him. Runner-up Steve, who also hailed from Des Moines, seemed to recognize that the top spot was taken and refused to go down the catwalk. Much to the amusement of the audience, his owner had to lift and plunk him down in front of the judges. Princess Mabel Duchess impressed the judges with her friendly demeanor and blinking blue hair extensions, taking home the Ms. Congeniality Award. Linus the Lovebugs heart-shaped sunglasses and glittery ladybug wings earned her the title of best-dressed. Several other awards were also given but in the end, it was all about Tank, who appeared to enjoy the attention as he sat regally wearing the coveted crown and cape. Smith says that he knew he had a winner on his hands, the day he adopted the gorgeous dog. When he is not flaunting his good looks at pageants, Tank loves to play tug-of-war and socialize with the neighbors. 
Dogs	 On Saturday April, 25th, a little before noon local time, the tiny landlocked country of Nepal was jolted by a massive earthquake. The 7.8 magnitude tremor that was felt across four countries and affected over 6.6 million people, is the most powerful one the country has experienced in over eight decades. Not surprisingly, it has resulted in a large number of deaths and extensive property damage. While officials currently estimate the death toll to be about 4,000, the numbers could go up substantially as reports from the rugged hillsides that make up most of this impoverished country, come in. Thousands more are injured and even more are without shelter. As strong aftershocks continue to ripple through the area, even residents whose homes are not destroyed have taken to living on the streets. While the magnitude of the earthquake was certainly a factor, experts say the shallowness and the length of the tremor that lasted about 20 seconds, also contributed to the massive destruction. The fact that a majority of the buildings and homes are not built to withstand big tremors did not help. The ripple effect of the earthquake whoseepicenter was 50km from Nepals capital Kathmandu, were felt across northern India, Tibet and Bangladesh, where it killed 36, 12 and 4 residents, respectively. The quake also caused a massive avalanche at the Mount Everest base camp, killing 18 climbers and injuring at least 30. Many climbers are still missing. In addition to the devastating loss of lives, the earthquake has also reduced some of Nepals historic landmarks to rubble. Among them is Kathmandus Dharahara Tower. Built in 1832, the nine-story brick structure was a popular tourist destination. Also destroyed was the Maju Deval Temple. The Unesco World Heritage Site was built in 1690. The only silver lining was that the earthquake occurred on a Saturday, which means that children were not at school. The irony is that just a week ago, 50 earthquake and social scientists from around the world had arrived at Kathmandu to help prepare the congested city for a big tremor. Seismologist James Jackson, the lead scientist for Earthquakes without Frontiers who experienced the earthquake firsthand, says Physically and geologically what happened is exactly what we thought would happen. The only thing the experts miscalculated was the timing! They had not anticipated a big one this soon. While not much can be done about what happened, the world is now rushing to do whatever it can to help the people of Nepal. In addition to the typical aid relief from the Red Cross and countries all over the world, corporations like Google and Facebook are using their worldwide reach to help connect loved ones. Wireless services provider T-Mobile and Internet calling company Viber, have waived fees for all calls and texts to and from Nepal. While it will take the country some time to recover, the new Nepal will hopefully comprise of safer structures, ones that can withstand even the most severe tremors. Nepals position at the junction of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates, the collision of which resulted in the Himalayas, is the reason the country is prone to earthquakes. As the Indian plate continues to push north toward Asia, it rubs against the Eurasian plate. This generates stress and energy that builds up until the earths crust finally ruptures. To make matters worse, Nepal sits on a thrust fault. Unlike normal faults that create space when the ground cracks, thrust faults cause the tectonic plates to force themselves atop one another. This results in extremely severe movements. According the Hongfend Yang, an earthquake expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Saturdays massive earthquake resulted in the Indian plate jumping forward by a stunning 2 meters or 6.5 feet! 
Tweens	In the days after a crushing earthquake hit the country of Nepal on April 25, there is still time to save lives.  Many governments and aid agencies are sending doctors, volunteers and equipment. They aren't waiting for the dust to settle. The estimates are that thousands of people have been killed. No one knows how many are injured or without food.U.N. spokeswoman Orla Fagan said preventing the spread of disease is one of the most important tasks facing aid workers. Nepal is between India and Tibet. It is home to Mount Everest, the world's largest mountain and part of the Himalayas. An avalanche caused by the quake killed some climbers on the mountain."There are 14 international medical teams on the way and either 14 or 15 international search-and-rescue teams on the way," Fagan said. "They need to get in as soon as possible. They will use military aircraft to get them into Nepal."Diarrhea was already a growing problem. A measles outbreak was feared. Vaccines are in short supply, the U.N. warned in a report.Substantial logistical hurdles remain. But there were hopeful signs as Kathmandu's international airport reopened. There were still delays as aftershocks continued. Some aid vehicles were able to travel over land from India to the stricken Nepalese city of Pokhara."That means supplies could potentially come in over land from India. That is a positive sign," said Ben Pickering, Save the Children's humanitarian adviser in Britain. "The airport opening is a small miracle."He cautioned that chaotic conditions may create a bottleneck at the airport. That could occur as governments and aid agencies try to bring in personnel and supplies.The need is great. UNICEF said Sunday that nearly 1 million children in areas affected by the earthquake are in "urgent need" of humanitarian assistance. UNICEF staff reported dwindling water supplies, power shortages and communications breakdowns.Celebrities like singer Shakira sent tweets appealing for help for UNICEF. The mobile payment company Square created a "cashtag" to donate: cash.me/$unicef. PayPal announced it was waiving fees for donations to several aid organizations.Information was still lacking about conditions at the earthquake's epicenter, Pickering said."Going forward it's about access to the epicenter and helicopters are the key," Pickering said. He added that Save the Children has emergency kits pre-positioned in three warehouses in Nepal. The organization plans to distribute bedding, buckets and other basic supplies to 2,000 families as quickly as possible.Other charities face similar roadblocks.International Search and Rescue Germany said a team of 52 relief workers including doctors, experts trained in searching for people buried under rubble and several dog squads were being flown in. The team will bring a mobile medical treatment center.Spokesman Stefan Heine said the priority was to get to the scene of the quake as quickly as possible. The goal is to find those still alive.They will be supported by numerous governments that have announced plans to send aid worth millions of dollars.A U.S. military plane departed Sunday morning for Nepal carrying 70 personnel. The group included a U.S. Agency for International Development disaster assistance response team. An urban search-and-rescue team from Fairfax, Virginia and 45 tons of cargo were also on board. California was sending a team of 57 urban search-and-rescue workers.The United Arab Emirates deployed an 88-member search-and-rescue team to Nepal. The Emirates Red Crescent also sent a team.The Israeli military said it is sending a 260-member mission. The group will provide immediate search-and-rescue help and medical aid. The mission includes approximately 95 tons of humanitarian and medical supplies and a medical staff of 122 doctors, nurses and paramedics. European nations deployed as well. France said it would send 11 rescuers on Sunday. Britain announced that an advance team of eight had been sent and that a $7.6 million aid package would be available. Italy deployed a team of experts from its Civil Protection Department as well as it foreign crisis team. The Swiss Foreign Ministry said a team of experts including a doctor, a building surveyor and water quality technician had left for Nepal.Poland is sending a rescue team of 81 firefighters. The country is providing heavy equipment and several dogs, as well several medics. The firefighters were delayed by aftershocks and confusion at Kathmandu's airport, said Pawel Fratczak, spokesman for firefighters.Canada sent an advance unit from its urban disaster search and rescue team. The unit includes medical personnel and humanitarian relief supplies.Volunteers from various British charities gathered at London's Heathrow Airport. They prepared for flights to the Nepal region. Gary Francis is the leader of the Search and Rescue Assistance in Disasters group. He said the organization was bringing in enough tents, food and water to operate self-sufficiently for 15 days.They were bringing in "a vast array" of equipment. It included sound and vibration detectors, seismic listening devices and cutting equipment. Their goal would be to find survivors. U.N. humanitarian chief Valerie Amos said "entire areas have been flattened." She said time is very important in search-and-rescue efforts.
Tweens	You asked us, how do vaccines work? Well, vaccines are basically a stupendously brilliant way to train ourselves to fight some downright nasty, even deadly diseases.Let me explain.When we get sick from viruses or bacteria, our immune system creates weapons that attack the invading germs, but every disease is a little different, so we need to develop unique ammo for each one.And that can take time, which we don't always have, because some infections work fast and furious, never really giving us a chance to defend ourselves and the results can be deadly. The genius of vaccines is that they get our bodies to prep defense strategies without us having to actually get sick. Many do it by carrying a weaker or dead version of the germ, just enough to signal to our body to go on the attack, but not so much that an infection flares up.Our immune system then remembers the strategy for each defense, so if you ever come face to face with the real thing, we can get the upper hand by quickly pulling together a deadly strike force of our own. Many vaccines provide lifelong protection and though none is 100% effective, the more people in a population that get vaccinated the more we're able to control diseases. Thanks to vaccines smallpox is a thing of the past.Go science!For more stories like this, check us out every day at smithsonian.com.Go science, it's your birthday. Go science, it's your birthday.
Tweens	The most familiar mummies are the Egyptians, buried in elaborate tombs and surrounded with treasures to escort them into the afterlife.But not all mummies were Egyptian,  or even of the ruling class.Mummies have been found around the world, in circumstances ranging from honored leaders to unfortunate victims.What makes a mummy is its resistance to natural decay. Mummies are bodies that have preserved for long periods of time, either because people prepared them to last or because natural conditions caused accidental preservation.Each mummy is a time capsule that speaks to us from the past.Anthropologists who study mummies gather data from the skeleton as well as the clothing, jewelry, coffin or other accessories.These artifacts provide cultural context that might reveal how the person lived and died.These days, scientists try to peer inside mummies without destroying the linen strips or other materials wrapping the body or the body itself. X-rays are used to see the skeletal structure, while CT Scans can show soft tissues in three dimensions.Find out more about how scientists unravel the mysteries of mummies by joining us on Thursday, May 7, 2015, for a "Smithsonian Science How" live webcast titled Mummy Science œôòó Natural and Cultural Preserved Remains, airing at 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. EDT on the Q?rius website.Dr. David Hunt from the Physical Anthropology Division at the National Museum of Natural History will appear live to discuss and answer questions.You can get teaching resources to support your webcast experience.
Tweens	Think Jaws meets a kangaroo, with maybe a touch of cute kitten and you've got the aptly named pocket shark, the newest and rarest species found off the U.S. coast.Surprised scientists found a tiny, young version of the extraordinarily rare shark that was fished out of the deep Gulf of Mexico in 2010 with lots of other creatures in a government research trip. The dead specimen spent more than three years in a giant freezer waiting to be identified.It turned out to be only the second of its species ever seen. The first pocket shark was found 36 years ago in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Peru and it's been sitting in a Russian museum ever since.This pocket shark was a male, maybe a few weeks old, about 5.5 inches long. Strangely, this type of shark has two pockets next to its front fins; their purpose is not known. It's not quite like a kangaroo, which uses its pouch to carry young, but few species have pockets this large œôòô about 4 percent of the shark's body."It's cute," said Tulane University biologist Michael Doosey, who co-authored a study in a zoological journal identifying the shark. "It almost looks like a little whale."National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration fisheries biologist Mark Grace has spent more than 30 years going through bags upon bags of fish to identify them. It took him more than three years to get near the end of the freezer, when he plopped a bag on the table and let it thaw."I wasn't really sure what it was," Grace said. "That pocket over on the pectoral fin, I had never seen anything like that on a shark."It's a small miracle that the shark was not thrown away because a couple of times, the lab with the freezer lost power.Once identified, the shark was shipped to New York and France for high-tech examinations that wouldn't puncture the specimen.The shark also has unusual belly patches not seen in most sharks. The only other pocket shark was a female adult about 17 inches long; it is believed that adult females may be larger than males.But the truly strange thing about this species is its twin pockets. While no one knows what they are for, Grace and Doosey speculated that they may secrete some kind of glowing fluid or pheromones.The Gulf specimen has umbilical scars, showing he's probably a few weeks old, Grace said. Because of that, they think he was born in the Gulf. He was captured in February 2010 by the ship Pisces about 190 miles off the Louisiana coast."There's others" out there, Grace said. "We just haven't caught them yet."
Tweens	The nation's biggest city, New York, is announcing the ambitious goal of reducing its waste output by 90 percent by 2030.The plan includes an overhaul of the city's recycling program. It includes incentives to reduce waste. It also includes tacit support for the City Council's plan to dramatically reduce the use of plastic shopping bags. It was announced by Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio. The announcement came on Earth Day, which was April 22.New York has about 8.5 million residents. It would be the largest city in the Western Hemisphere to adopt such a plan. Its aim is to reduce the amount of the city's waste by more than 3 million tons from its 2005 level. That was about 3.6 million tons.The waste reduction plan is part of an update to the project created by de Blasio's predecessor, Michael Bloomberg. De Blasio is keeping its components but rebranding it OneNYC.The average New Yorker throws out nearly 15 pounds of waste a week. That adds up to millions of tons a year, de Blasio said in a statement to The Associated Press. "To be a truly sustainable city, we need to tackle this challenge head on."For decades, the city's trash has been exported by rail or barge. It is sent to South Carolina, Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania or upstate New York. The new plan would eliminate almost all of the garbage exports. They cost the city more than $350 million a year.The amount of waste produced by the city has fallen 14 percent since 2005. That is due to an increase in recycling. A key component of the plan is to bolster that output by simplifying the process.Currently, residential buildings have two types of recycling bins. The city's new single-stream plan would consolidate all recycling into one bin by 2020.Organics œôòô such as food scraps and yard waste œôòô make up 31 percent of the city's residential waste stream. A program to collect that material directly from residents' homes is being expanded. The goal is to reach nearly 200,000 residents by year's end. Officials want to serve every home in the city by the end of 2018. The city also will offer economic incentives to participate. The incentives could eventually include a property tax rebate for homeowners.The city also aims to reduce commercial waste by 90 percent by 2030. It would adopt a program similar to what is being used in residential buildings. That could also mean tax incentives for businesses that participate. Those that don't take part could be fined.The de Blasio administration stopped short of endorsing a City Council bill. It proposes a 10-cent fee on plastic bags. Officials said that reducing their use is a priority.The OneNYC presentation is meant to build on de Blasio's environmental record. That includes a ban on Styrofoam boxes. The goal is to reduce carbon emissions from city buildings by 80 percent by 2050.Environmental groups applauded the plan's wide-ranging scope."We see cities all over the world struggling with waste," said Michael Berkowitz. He is president of 100 Resilient Cities. "A more efficient city is a more resilient city. And that means it's a stronger city."
Tweens	Scientists are getting their best look yet at the DNA code for the woolly mammoth, work that could be a step toward bringing back the extinct beast.Researchers deciphered the complete DNA code, or genomes, of two mammoths. The new genomes are far more refined than a previous one announced, in 2008. DNA determines what traits a living organism will have.One new genome comes from a mammoth that lived about 45,000 years ago in northeastern Siberia. The other comes from a creature that lived about 4,300 years ago on Russia's Wrangel Island in the Arctic Circle.The results were announced in a paper released by the journal Current Biology. The DNA was extracted from a tooth and a sample of soft tissue.Woolly mammoths were about as big as modern African elephants and they sport long curved tusks and thick hairy coats. They are the best-known species of mammoth. The information comes from frozen and often well-preserved carcasses in Siberia.The Wrangel Island population was the last of the creatures to go extinct. Some scientists have suggested that mammoths could be created anew through genetic engineering, an idea not everybody favors.Love Dalen of the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm, an author of the new study, said re-creating mammoths is not a goal of his research team and he's also "very uncertain" that it's even possible.Still, he wrote in an email, "Our genomes bring us one critical step closer to re-creating a mammoth .... I think it would be cool if it could be done, but I'm not sure it should be done."One ethical drawback, he said, is that elephants would be used as surrogate mothers to carry the genetically engineered mammoth embryos. That species mismatch might lead to problems that cause the mothers to suffer, he said.Hendrik Poinar of Canada's McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, who is another author of the study, said the new work "gives us at least a blueprint to work from."Poinar said mammoths could be a welcome addition if re-introduced to the wild, but if they were made just for exhibition at zoos, "I don't see any good in that at all."
