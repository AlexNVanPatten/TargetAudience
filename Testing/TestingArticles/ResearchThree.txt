This article provides an overview of learning progressions (LP) and assesses the potential of this line of research to improve geography education. It presents the merits and limitations of three of the most common approaches used to conduct LP research and draws on one approach to propose a first draft of a LP on map reading and interpretation. It also highlights findings from LP research that may be especially significant for future work in geography education. The article concludes with a description of a new research project, GeoProgressions, to build capacity for LP research in geography. As part of A Road Map for 21st Century Geography Education: Geography Education Research (a report from the Geography Education Research Committee of the Road Map for 21st Century Geography Education Project; Bednarz, Heffron, and Huynh 2013), the committee conducted a review of geography education research published in the last decade. The findings reveal a field that is disconnected from educational research in other disciplines, including social studies. Moreover, the review found that much of the existing body of geography education research is limited to designs involving low numbers of study participants, disaggregated topics on student learning, and with few examples of longitudinal studies. The Geography Education Research Committee report recommended parallels, closer alignments, and linkages with the systematic research approaches taken in mathematics and science education, with emphasis on the potential value of learning progressions (LP), as a strategy to improve the quality and quantity of research in geography education. Of the 400+ articles reviewed for theRoad Map report from three prominent geography education journals (national and international), we found no LP research in the literature. The Road Map report presents LP as an area that can potentially contribute to a deeper understanding of the teaching and learning process in geography. At the same time, LP research may foster productive research collaborations between geography, mathematics, and science education researchers.This article summarizes LP research and how this information is being used to build the capacity of geographers to conduct systematic and coordinated research on ways students learn geography. We begin by explaining LP as it has been defined and developed in mathematics and science education. Next, we consider the merits and limitations of three of the most common approaches utilized to conduct research in LP, drawing on one approach to propose a first draft of a map reading and interpretation LP. We also highlight findings from LP research that may be especially significant for future work in geography education. We conclude with a description of a new program, GeoProgressions,1 designed to lay the groundwork for strategic, coordinated research on LP in geography. A hypothesized learning progression (LP), also known as a hypothesized learning trajectory (LT), is a “description of the successively more sophisticated ways of thinking about a topic that can follow one another as children learn” (National Research Council 2007, 219). In essence, the researcher seeks to acquire quantitative and qualitative evidence of students’ thinking and how it develops over time in relation to a topic, concept, or practice. Generally, the terms hypothesized learning progressions andhypothesized learning trajectory are used to represent similar ideas in science education and mathematics education, respectively. However, sometimes when the latter term is used in science education, it also refers to smaller sequences of LP that have a more narrow time span and grain size (Duschl, Maeng, and Sezen 2011). In this article, we will consider the term LP to be synonymous with learning trajectories. The idea of research on progressions of learning is not new; it is similar to other models of developmental and progressive learning such as the spiral curriculum (Bruner 1960) and learning hierarchies (Gagné and Briggs 1974). The premise of a LP is that empirical data can provide testable hypotheses about how students’ knowledge and skills develop and are organized as they learn (Duncan andHmelo-Silver 2009; Mosher 2011). LP research in math and science has been conducted using a number of methodologies but with a general agreement on measuring differences in learning along a continuum, following a hypothesized progression, from a lower to an upper anchor. Anchors are expectations of what students ought to know about a target topic at a specific grade or age. The lower anchor refers to the knowledge and practices learners possess when they enter the progression, whereas the upper anchor describes what students are expected to know and be able to do by the end of the LP (Duncan and Hmelo-Silver 2009; Duschl, Maeng, and Sezen 2011). The idea that the hypothesized LP is a bridge between resources of large-scale time frames (e.g., standards, curricula, and assessments) and research focused on short time periods has been proposed by several researchers (e.g., Baroody et al. 2004; Anderson 2008). The resulting predictions about the learning process can inform the design of content standards for different academic subjects and serve to support instructional methods (Adadan, Trundle, and Irving 2010; Furtak et al. 2010; Sztajn et al.2012; Mojica and Confrey 2009) and assessment practices (Alonzo 2011; Alonzo and Gearhart 2006). Standards are based primarily on the logic of the discipline as organized by adult stakeholders’ (e.g., academics and teachers) experience regarding what, when, and how concepts are taught (Corcoran, Mosher, and Rogat 2009; Mosher 2011). A LP, on the other hand, emphasizes how students learn within the scope and sequence of formal education as expressed in standards and curricula. For an in-depth review of foundational ideas that shape our thinking about LP, see Duschl, Maeng, and Sezen (2011). It is important to note that there may be multiple pathways to learning, and thus a validated progression of thinking does not necessarily make it the best or only path for effective learning and teaching (Baroody et al. 2004; Clements and Sarama 2004; Corcoran, Mosher, and Rogat 2009). Nonetheless, understanding student thinking has tremendous practical value for designing appropriate learning opportunities, instructional materials, and assessments. We discuss these merits and limitations as well as three methodologies of LP in the following section. For a detailed comparison of LP and LT, see Ellis, Weber, and Lockwood (2014).
