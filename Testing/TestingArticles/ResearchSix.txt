 Research into the distance learning of languages is now established as a significant avenue of enquiry in language teaching, with evident research trajectories in several domains. This article selects and analyses significant areas of investigation in distance language learning and teaching to identify new and emerging gaps, along with research questions, methodologies and research tools. Taken together these define a research agenda focusing on theory, pedagogy, technology use, learner contributions, innovation and less commonly taught languages. Within those broad areas, the scope of proposed research tasks includes the distinctive features and practices of distance language teaching, task design for synchronous settings, mentoring, multimodal learning environments, the transfer of speaking skills, and learners’ affective experiences. To conclude, a number of guidelines are given for future enquiry addressing the distinctive nature of research into distance language teaching and learning and the need for a rich evidence base in both theory and practice. The nature and scope of research into distance language learning (DLL) has opened up quite markedly since the publication of my state-of-the-art article (White 2006), with expanding research trajectories in multimodality, learner contributions and teacher training, and the development of further theoretical and pedagogical frameworks. The field has seen the development of empirically-based models for the evaluation of both distance language programs (Madyarov 2009) and of synchronous learning management systems (Wang & Chen 2009); new theoretical models of DLL have also been developed (Andrade & Bunker 2009; Bertin, Grave & Narcy-Combes2010; Lamy 2013), as have frameworks for teaching skills required in synchronous online environments (Guichon 2009) and for the design of online assessment (Wang & Chen 2013). Importantly, too, critical overviews of empirical research (Blake 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013; Vorobel & Kim 2012; Lamy 2013) have been proposed, together with the incorporation of distance learning as a theme in broader review articles on CALL and language for specific purposes (Lafford 2009; Levy 2009; Arnó-Macià 2012; Grgurovi?, Chapelle & Shelley 2013). This article proposes a research agenda that will guide scholarship to address emerging issues and to contribute a stronger evidence base for theory building and practice. To do this I work broadly within the framework of the 2006 overview article, which continues to offer a helpful way of framing the field, thus allowing the reader to compare the shifts and developments in those substantive areas. However, given the increasing range of research trajectories in DLL there remain a number of areas that are not addressed directly in the scope of this agenda: these include the distance learning of Chinese (Tasker 2010; Alvarez & Qian 2013; Stickler & Shi 2013; Qian & McCormick 2014), the development of intercultural competence (Alvarez & Qian 2013), telecollaborative distance language projects (Hauck & Youngs 2008; Stickler & Emke 2011; vom Brocke et al. 2010) and mobile language learning (Kukulska-Hulme & Shield 2008; Comas-Quinn, Mardomingo & Valentino 2009; Demouy & Kukulska-Hulme 2010; Kukulska-Hulme 2010; Pegrum (2014)). I begin with the developing knowledge base into paradigms and theories of DLL.
