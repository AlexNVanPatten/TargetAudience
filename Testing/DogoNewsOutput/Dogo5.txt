 If you make a list of the worlds top ten most challenging jobs, chances are that being a teacher will not make the cut. But think about the daunting task millions of educators face each day as they try to mold a group of often surly, unruly kids into intelligent, well-rounded individuals. That surely has to be the toughest job in the world, especially given that there is no promotion or bonus awaiting them even if they are wildly successful! What if these all-important individuals that we often take for granted disappear from our lives? That was what Project Ed and Participant Medias Teach campaign asked filmmakers of all ages to envision for their recently held contest. Entitled, A World Without Teachers, its intent was to inspire more young people to become teachers. However, the 62 amazing video submissions also serve as a reminder of how grim things would be if we didnt have these selfless individuals guiding us through life. What was interesting is that even the youngest contestants did not appear to rejoice at the idea of not having anybody telling them what to do. High-school student Savannah Wakefield pondered if art as we know it today would have been different without teachers. Would Monet have discovered his talent for impressionism? Los Angeles-based Miles Horst, who won the 1,000 USD prize for the best adult submission imagines a world where teachers are replaced by a brain box in his fun animated entry. Youth category winner Marina Barhams video depicts a fact we all know but often forget. Teachers dont just teach, they inspire - something that no electronic device, no matter how smart, can do! So the next time you think your teacher is being mean for trying to channel you in the right direction, imagine a life without him/her. We have a feeling it will not appear as rosy!
