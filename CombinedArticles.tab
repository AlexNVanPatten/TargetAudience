Dogs	  Water, foam, sand, blankets, and even baking soda are well-known solutions to putting out flames. But sound waves? That has to be a first. But that is exactly what two young engineers from George Mason University are using to douse small fires. Electrical and computer engineering students Viet Tran and Seth Robertson were looking for an interesting idea for their senior research project. Thats when they stumbled upon an experiment conducted by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA ) in 2012. Called acoustic suppression of flame it was abandoned after the agency was unable to determine its effectiveness on a large scale. Tran and Robertson decided to challenge themselves and see if they could take the research to the next level and build a fire extinguisher that could be used commercially. As with any radical idea, they faced a lot of skepticism even from faculty members many of whom declined to serve as advisors. After all, neither of the students were chemical engineers so what could they possibly know about creating a fire extinguisher? The students were finally able to convince Professor Brian Mark who agreed to oversee the project and not fail them, if they were unable to make the concept work. The young engineers first tried to extinguish the fire by placing a subwoofer near a flame created using rubbing alcohol. But they soon realized that music is not such a good idea since it is inconsistent and unpredictable. The next option was exposing the fire to 20,000 to 30,000 hertz frequencies. However with the high frequencies, the flames only vibrated. The duo hit a home run when they reduced the frequency to about 30 to 60 hertz. Turns out that at these low frequencies, the sound vibrates the oxygen away from the flames. With no fuel to keep them going, the fire suffocates and dies. The 20 lbs prototype that looks like an antique milk can is connected to a well-ventilated amp. A bass speaker fixed above the barrel amplifies and directs the sound waves. While it can currently put out only small alcohol-fueled fires, the students hope to make it work for other flammable chemicals as well. Also, although Tran and Robertson had initially envisioned the handheld extinguisher to be for home or space use, they now believe it could even work for larger fires. A local fire department has already shown interest in testing the extinguisher on a structure fire, in the hopes of replacing toxic and messy chemicals with clean sound waves! Though the young students appear to have convinced many of the initial skeptics, Kenneth E Isman, a clinical professor at the University of Marylands fire-protection engineering department, is not amongst them. He believes that while the extinguisher may be good enough to put out small pan fires, it will not be able to deal with larger domestic fires. He is also concerned that the sound waves do not cool the flames down. This means that the minute they get exposed to oxygen they could easily rekindle. However, Tran and Robertson are not letting naysayers stray them from their goal. They are forging ahead with their idea, this time with the full support of the University who is even helping them apply for a provisional patent. If they do succeed, there may be soon be a time when fire trucks will be extinguishing flames with some sweet music, instead of messy toxic chemicals! 
Dogs	 Over the past few years, researchers have come up with many innovative ways to use human kinetic energy - from powering soccer fields to playgrounds and classroom lights. Now some scientists want to take it to the next level with a new fabric that harnesses everyday motion to power personal devices! The brainchild of a team of scientists from South Koreas Sungkyunkwan University and Australias University of Wollongong, the electricity producing fabric takes advantage of the Triboelectric effect (TNG). Also known as friction energy it is the electricity created when two different kinds of surfaces rub against one another. While this sounds complicated, it is something we have all encountered. Remember the age-old trick of rubbing your head on a balloon to make your hair stand up? That is the triboelectric effect. As the surfaces rub together, the electrons move from one surface to the other. This leaves one object negatively charged (balloon) and the other positively charged (hair). Since opposites attract, the electrons in the hair leap toward the balloon causing it to stand up. To create the wearable triboelectric nanogenerator (WTNG), the researchers first layered the upper and lower side of the fabric with silver. They then inserted a polymer sheet covered with zinc oxide between the two. When the person wearing the clothing moves, the minuscule zinc-oxide rods rub against the silver coated cloth creating friction energy. The polymer picks up the electrons moving from one layer to another and uses the electricity generated to charge the electrical gizmos embedded in the clothing. In trials, the scientists were able to power a small screen, some LED lights, and a keyless car remote control. Not surprisingly, multiple layers of WTNG were more effective at generating electricity than a single layer. What is impressive is that the material can capture energy from even the smallest of movements. This means that a user does not need to run a marathon for the technology to be effective. This is not the first attempt at creating TNG wearables. However, past renditions have been unsuccessful due to the short battery life and because the materials were stiff and therefore uncomfortable to wear. The WNTG not only eliminates the need for batteries, but also looks and feels like a regular fabric. Another issue was that repeated wear or a trip to the laundry machine would wash away the silver and zinc coating. The researchers solved this problem by covering the layers with a thin film of plastic. In their laboratory trials they were able to use the fabric for more than 12,000 cycles. Sang-Woo Kim and this team who reported their invention in the March ACS journal say that the fabrics use goes beyond charging personal devices. They believe it could also be useful in a range of biomedical and other personal healthcare gizmos that need a reliable power source. 
Dogs	 Environmentalists use different tactics to raise public awareness. Some organize rallies, others set up petitions, and then there is Lewis Gordon Pugh. This activist and adventurer highlights the planets woes by swimming in the vulnerable ecosystems of some of the worlds coldest waters. If that sends a chill down your spine, consider this - the activist swims wearing only a Speedo swimsuit! His past endeavors include being the first human to swim in the Arctic - a feat that earned him the nickname of human polar bear. In 2010, Pugh took the plunge into the Khumbu Glacier Lake on the slopes of the Himalayas to draw attention to the mountains rapidly melting glaciers. However, his latest adventure in the southernmost part of the planet is the most difficult and dangerous one he has undertaken thus far. From February 13 to March 7, Pugh conducted a series of five swims in Antarcticas Ross Sea. During each of the swims that were spread over three weeks, Pugh spent about 20 minutes in water temperatures as low as minus 1.7C (28.94F), just 0.3C shy of the freezing point of salt water. While that may not seem like much, Pugh says that any additional time spent in water this cold would kill him. If that wasnt bad enough, he also had to watch out for the aggressive Leopard seals and killer sharks, that inhabit the freezing waters. Fortunately, besides chased down by an overzealous seal, Pugh emerged relatively unscathed. While the swims did help Pugh establish yet another record for being the first to swim in the most southerly part of the planet, that was not the reason he pursued the life-threatening mission. The 45-year-old hopes that his swims will persuade the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) to set aside a marine protection area the size of UK, Germany and France in the Ross Sea. Home to the Antarctic Toothfish, the Colossal Squid, and the Emperor Penguin, it is currently one of the most pristine areas in the world. While there has been some commercial fishing in the region since the 1990s, the ecosystem has yet to be affected. Pugh hopes that he can convince the officials to put a protection order in place, before that changes. The activist realizes his stunt may not convince the members of CCAMLR which consists of representatives from 24 countries and the European Union. However, it will not be for lack of trying and that, is all Pugh can do! The British endurance swimmer who also happens to be a marine lawyer has not always been an activist. Inspired by explorers like Roald Amundsen (first person to traverse the Antarctica) and Edmund Hillary (first person to climb Mt. Everest), Pugh decided to become a pioneer swimmer. However, as he was trying to fulfill his quest to be first to swim across all seven oceans, he experienced firsthand, the effects of global warming. The alarming rate at which he observed glaciers melting and animals disappearing, transformed him into one of the worlds most passionate ocean advocates. As to how he manages to endure the freezing waters? In addition to training in frozen pools and putting on some weight (have you seen a cold whale?), Pugh also uses a swim technique that is unique to him. Called anticipatory thermogenesis, it is the ability to raise his body temperature from 98.6F to 103F (from 37C to 39.5C), and heart rate from 70 to 160 beats a second. This is similar to the state of a normal human following a long run, except Lewis does it with the power of his mind! Once he is hot and sweaty, he plunges in! As for the Speedo? The adventurer says, Swimming in Speedos shows commitment, courage, and integrity, and it opens doors and gives me access to world leaders! We sure hope all his hard work to save the Ross Sea pays off. 
Dogs	 At first sight, Elana Schlenkers pop-up store, Less Than 100, which was open in Pittsburgh during the month of April appeared just like any other gift store. However, when shoppers went to pay, they were in for a surprise. Thats because while men paid full price, women received a 14% discount. Though that may appear to be blatant discrimination, Elana was merely abiding by the stores slogan pay what you are paid. And since women in the US get paid an average of 76 cents for every dollar men earn for the same job, it is only fair that they pay less. As if the stores pricing policy was not enough to get the message across, Elana also distributed pamphlets. Entitled What Are Women Worth?, it explained the status of the wage gap both in Pennsylvania and across the country, and also gave women tips on how to better negotiate salaries. A 2015 study conducted by the Institute for Womens Policy Research found that although the rate of womens income has been rising, men still earn more in every state in the country. But though paying women less wages is a shame, forking out the full price at Less Than 100 wasnt necessarily a bad thing. Thats because the proceeds of all sales went directly to the local artists that had created the beautiful wares. During its month-long tenure, the shop was visited by hundreds of women who wanted to support her mission and the local artists whose work was being showcased. Some even brought in their kids and grandkids to educate them about theimportance of keeping the gender wage debate alive. Elana says that while she received some grief about the discrimination, most men were extremely gracious and happy to pay the full price. Not surprisingly, the unusual venture has drawn worldwide attention. This November, Elana will partner with photographer Tammy Mercure and open a Less than 100 pop-up store in New Orleans.She believes starting the debate in Louisiana is important given that the state boasts the nations widest gender wage disparity. Here, women earn a whopping 34 cents less than their male counterparts. While she has received several requests from California, it may be close to the bottom of her list. Thats because the Golden State is one of the most progressive when it comes to wage equality, and therefore does not need much help. Though the Less than 100 project will not resolve the wage disparity, it is a thought-provoking way to bring to the forefront an issue that is increasingly causing a lot of angst among women. Fortunately, Elana is not the only one trying to change the unfair system. Patricia Arquette made an impassioned plea for gender wage equality in her acceptance speech at the Oscars this February. Ellen Pao the interim CEO of Reddit recently announced that new employees will be forbidden from negotiating salaries. She believes that men are better negotiators then women, and therefore tend to receive higher wages! Whats encouraging is that male CEOs are also joining the fight! Earlier this month, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff launched a company wide program to address the issue. Called Women Surge it aims to eliminate all gender-based pay disparities, hire and promote more women and ensure that they are better included in meetings! With all these visionaries taking the lead, it will not be long before gender pay inequality is something we will only read about in history books! 
Dogs	 Researchers recently reported the discovery of three new species of dragons in the Andean cloud forests of Ecuador and Peru. However, dont run for cover yet, for these are not fire-breathing beasts that kidnap fair maidens and battle knights in shining armor. Instead, they are just tiny wood lizards that are often referred to as miniature dragons thanks to their close resemblance to the mythical creatures. Though giants amongst the smaller lizards that dwell in the Amazon rainforests, wood lizards measure a mere three to six inches in length. The diurnal creatures feature intricately patterned skins that help them easily blend into their lush environment. The three new species unveiled by a team of scientists led by Omar Torres-Carvajal of Ecuador in the scientific journal Zookeys on April 6th, add to the twelve already known to scientists. According to Omar, when he began researching wood lizards in 2006, only seven species of the colorful dragons had been found. In fact, scientists had concluded that they were one of the less diverse groups of South American lizards. Hence finding new ones always comes as a pleasant surprise. Whats cool is that each of the newly found miniature dragons have distinct coloring and features. Enyalioides altotambo Named after the town of Alto Tambo, Ecuador where the lizard was discovered, this reptile sports a bright green color and a thick neck. According to the researchers, both male and female lizards bear an eerie resemblance to Gronckle the toughest (and slowest)dragon in the How to Train Your Dragon movie series. Enyalioides sophiarothschildae Discovered in northern Peru, the wood lizard is greenish-black, with a distinct white patch near its throat and large scales across its spine. It was named after a donor to BIOPAT, a German nonprofit organization that funds biodiversity and conservation research. Enyalioides anisolepis Anisolepis means unequal scales in Greek. This is a fitting name for the five-inch long reptile that has scales of varying sizes on its legs, flanks and back. It also has conical spikes emerging from the back of its head. While the males are a black and green hue, the females are speckled light brown. The tiny dragons are found at altitudes of between 2,375 to 5,715 feet in northern Peru and southern Ecuador. While these are certainly amazing, there may be many more miniature and perhaps even giant dragons just waiting to be discovered in the Andean cloud forests. According to conservation group Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund, the pristine region is home to 20,000 unique plants, over 1,500 terrestrial vertebrates and thousands of amphibians and birds. We, for one, cannot wait to find out what the scientists uncover next. 
Dogs	 While the sight of an 18-ton subway car being dumped into the Atlantic Ocean may appear like an ecological disaster, it is quite the opposite. Instead of harming marine life, the sturdy steel structures submerged deep into the Atlantic Ocean transform into perfect artificial reefs that provide comfortable homes for all kinds of sea creatures. The idea of the unusual disposal method was inspired by the State of Delawares artificial reef program. Started in 1995, it entailed sinking decommissioned tankers, naval ships and tugboats to the bottom of the Atlantic. According to officials, the program was necessary because of the loose sand and silt that make it impossible for natural reefs to form. In 2001 when the New York Metropolitan Transit Department (MTA) retired a fleet of 619 Redbird subway cars, they offered them to East Coast States that wished to start a similar program. According to Mike Zacchea, the Assistant Chief Operations Officer at MTA, the decision was driven largely by the cost of recycling the large number of cars. He said that the cost of removing the asbestos from the chassis would have cost the department between $12,000 to 65,000 USD for each of the cars. In contrast, transporting and dumping them set the transit department back by a mere $8,000 USD. The State of Delaware received most of the subway cars simply because the other states were not sure of their use as an artificial reef. That, of course, changed once they saw the success of the states Redbird Reef project. By the time the MTA ended its subway replacement project in 2010, over 2,500 retired subway cars, had found a new home all the way from Delaware to Georgia. Together they form 15 underwater reefs that support the life of numerous fish and crustaceans. Prepping for what Delawares reef program manager Jeff Tinsman calls luxury condominiums for fish, did take some time. While the small amount of asbestos in the subway cars was considered safe underwater, pollutants like oil had to be removed. In addition, the cars were also stripped of the seats, straps, and wheels that are either recycled or sold. Only after the structures met the strict guidelines of the US. Environmental Protection Agency were they allowed to be dumped into the ocean. The artificial reefs are still constantly monitored and studied to ensure they dont pose any threat to the underwater sea life. Thus far, numerous sea creatures have successfully converted the carbon steel subway cars into their new homes. In many instances, the metal surfaces are covered in algae, making them almost unrecognizable. In addition to shelter, the reefs provide 400 times as much food per square foot as the natural sand bottom. The dual role that the reefs play is particularly beneficial to fish such as black sea bass, which are not fast swimmers and need help escaping from sharks and other predators. An added benefit is the economic boost it provides the various states thanks to the increase in recreational activities like scuba diving. While the success of this unusual project has been known to a few, it has recently garnered public attention thanks to Stephen Mallon, a photographer who has followed the recycling efforts for many years. His recently held exhibition entitled Patterns of Interest vividly depicts a three-year journey of subway cars from carbon steel structures to robust marine abodes. Though the subway cars program came to an end in 2010, when the MTA stopped donating, some states have continued the program using other safe manmade structures like retired Navy tankers. 
Dogs	 Though there are numerous ultramarathons, competitions that exceed running or walking the traditional 26.2 miles, very few compare to The Barkley Marathons. The annual 100-mile race that challenges participants both mentally and physically has been completed by only 14 of the 1,100 total participants in its 30-year history. To put it in perspective, that is just two more than the number of people that have walked on the moon! Held annually in Wartburg, Tennessees Frozen Head State Park, the competition that takes place in late March or early April is the brainchild of ultrarunner Gary Cantrell. The ex-elite runner says his inspiration for the race came from James Earl Ray, the man accused of assassinating Martin Luther King Jr. In 1977, Ray escaped from the Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary at the foot of Frozen Head State Park. When captured 55 hours later, he had managed to cover a distance of just 8.5 miles thanks to the treacherous terrain. Cantrell decided to raise the bar with a course that consists of a 20-mile loop that runners need to complete five times in 60 hours. In order to compete for the coveted 35-40 spots, candidates have to not only prove their fitness but also write an essay on why they should be allowed to run. Then they have to do some investigative work on where to send the application; a difficult task given that the location is a closely guarded secret. Also, the applications have to get to Cantrell at midnight on Christmas day. Even a five-minute delay could result in disqualification. Things dont get any easier for the competitors that get accepted. Thats because the course, which changes annually, is revealed the day prior to the race, making any training impossible. The only thing contestants know for sure is that it will include the Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary tunnel from where James Earl Ray escaped. The actual start time of the 100-mile race is also shrouded in mystery. Runners set up camp at the Frozen Head State Park on Friday and then wait for the sound of Cantrells conch shell which alerts them that the race will commence in an hour. Since the horn can sound anytime between midnight to noon on Saturday, they have to be alert at all times. The oddities continue even when its time to race. Instead of signaling the start of the race with a starter pistol, Cantrell opts for a lighter and cigarette. The race itself must be completed in 60 hours or less, and no more than 12 hours can be spent completing each loop. Also, while the runner can choose his/her direction during the first, second, and final 20-mile loop, the third and fourth loops have to be run in opposite directions. In addition to the treacherous terrain, contestants also have to contend with the elevation. Cantrell estimates that during the five laps, contestants will climb approximately 62,000 feet - the equivalent of climbing Mount Everest twice! And if that is not stressful enough, there are only two fixed water-refilling locations and no medical personnel available to aid those in distress. Cantrell also forbids the use of GPS tracking devices or cell phones. Instead, participants have to find their way amidst the unmarked trails using a map and compass. In order to prove they completed the course, runners have to seek out books placed along the course and tear out the pages that correspond to their race numbers. Those that fail to do so are immediately disqualified. However, if you think that all these hurdles deter participants, think again. Cantrell receives in excess of 200 applications each year, many from some of the worlds best athletes. It is no wonder that the slots are filled up within five minutes after the official opening. This year was no exception. 40 competitors, including a record nine women set out to complete this crazy race the weekend of March 28th, 2015. However, there were no winners. John Kelly, a 30-year-old electrical engineer, made it the farthest by successfully conquering three of the five loops in the given time. Others werent as lucky. One passed out on the ground after running 48 miles in 28 hours. Another was deemed lost when he failed to show up seven hours after the time limit for the race had passed. Just as a search party was being organized, he strolled in telling organizers that sheer exhaustion had caused him to take an eight-hour nap atop the mountain! Despite these horror stories, most plan to endure this mental and physical ordeal at least one more time and see if they can be amongst the few able to complete the worlds toughest race. 
Dogs	 For the casual visitor, Teller Lake in Boulder, Colorado looks like a delightful fishbowl filled with thousands of gorgeous orange, black, and white goldfish floating around. However, to the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Department they are a group of invasive species that could end up disrupting the lakes entire ecosystem if not removed soon. The problem lies in the fact that these fish are not native to the lake, which means that they have no predators. This allows them to reproduce and multiply in large numbers. In fact, park officials believe that the 3,000 - 4,000 specimens currently floating around are all a result of a few unwanted pet goldfish that were dumped into the lake. From the age of the fish, they estimate the incident occurred about three years ago. While that may appear to be the most humane thing to do, it is extremely dangerous, not to mention illegal. Thats because as this non-native species grow in numbers, they compete with the existing fish for food sources like plankton and small insects. Given that there is only a limited supply of resources, this could result in the goldfish overpowering the native fish species. In the case of Teller Lake, the officials are particularly worried that the goldfish will move downstream and affect the population of some of the endangered native species that live there. Another major cause for concern is the diseases the goldfish may be harboring. This could be fatal to the native species since they do not have the immunity to fight new illnesses. The Colorado Parks and Wildlife biologists, therefore, have no option but to extract the fish from the lake in most efficient manner. They are currently contemplating three options - draining the lake, stunning the fish with electricity or using a chemical that interferes with their respiratory system. The fish will then be sent to the local raptor rehabilitation facility and fed to injured birds of prey like eagles and osprey. This is not the first time Boulder has had to deal with unwanted goldfish. A few years ago, 2,275 specimens had to be extracted from the citys Thunderbird Lake. Of course, fish are not the only unwanted pets that get discarded. Florida has been combating an invasion of Burmese pythons since the 1980s and green iguanas since the mid-1990s. However, one of the worst cases of invasive species recorded is that of the Red Lionfish. The non-native species that was accidentally released in the Atlantic by an aquarium, is currently wreaking havoc to the Atlantic Oceans ecosystem all the way from South Florida to Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. According to experts, the best way to dispose of unwanted fish or any other animal is to get advice from the people that originally sold them the pet. They say that most owners believe they are doing the right thing by returning their exotic pet back to the wilderness. However, saving one pet often results in destroying the areas ecosystem and hurting other innocent animals. 
Dogs	 Every year, bulldogs from across the country make their way to Des Moines, Iowa to participate in Drake Universitys beautiful bulldog contest. In addition to the bragging rights that come with the title, the winner also gets to serve as the mascot of the prestigious Drake Relays - the nations second oldest track event. The event that celebrated 36 years on April 19th, is extremely popular attracting as many as 100 applicants each year. Unfortunately, only fifty lucky ones picked by lottery are allowed to participate. However, that does not mean the competition is any less intense. Every owner tries his/her best to showcase their pet by dressing them in all kinds of fun and outrageous outfits, ranging from ladybirds topirates. The dogs try to impress the judges by doing what they do best - drooling! According to the decision makers, in addition to being beautiful in the classic bulldog way with the bottom teeth sticking out, the dogs also have to be kind and gentle. Tank who was adopted from Craigslist by Des Moines resident Duane Smith in 2014, seemed to fit the bill. The two-year-old who shares a home with a Pomeranian and some turtles, first impressed the judges with his no-nonsense camouflaged outfit and military-style helmet. However, what appeared to seal the deal was his au natural look during the final round. As one of the judges succinctly put it, Tank just had a great look to him. Runner-up Steve, who also hailed from Des Moines, seemed to recognize that the top spot was taken and refused to go down the catwalk. Much to the amusement of the audience, his owner had to lift and plunk him down in front of the judges. Princess Mabel Duchess impressed the judges with her friendly demeanor and blinking blue hair extensions, taking home the Ms. Congeniality Award. Linus the Lovebugs heart-shaped sunglasses and glittery ladybug wings earned her the title of best-dressed. Several other awards were also given but in the end, it was all about Tank, who appeared to enjoy the attention as he sat regally wearing the coveted crown and cape. Smith says that he knew he had a winner on his hands, the day he adopted the gorgeous dog. When he is not flaunting his good looks at pageants, Tank loves to play tug-of-war and socialize with the neighbors. 
Dogs	 On Saturday April, 25th, a little before noon local time, the tiny landlocked country of Nepal was jolted by a massive earthquake. The 7.8 magnitude tremor that was felt across four countries and affected over 6.6 million people, is the most powerful one the country has experienced in over eight decades. Not surprisingly, it has resulted in a large number of deaths and extensive property damage. While officials currently estimate the death toll to be about 4,000, the numbers could go up substantially as reports from the rugged hillsides that make up most of this impoverished country, come in. Thousands more are injured and even more are without shelter. As strong aftershocks continue to ripple through the area, even residents whose homes are not destroyed have taken to living on the streets. While the magnitude of the earthquake was certainly a factor, experts say the shallowness and the length of the tremor that lasted about 20 seconds, also contributed to the massive destruction. The fact that a majority of the buildings and homes are not built to withstand big tremors did not help. The ripple effect of the earthquake whoseepicenter was 50km from Nepals capital Kathmandu, were felt across northern India, Tibet and Bangladesh, where it killed 36, 12 and 4 residents, respectively. The quake also caused a massive avalanche at the Mount Everest base camp, killing 18 climbers and injuring at least 30. Many climbers are still missing. In addition to the devastating loss of lives, the earthquake has also reduced some of Nepals historic landmarks to rubble. Among them is Kathmandus Dharahara Tower. Built in 1832, the nine-story brick structure was a popular tourist destination. Also destroyed was the Maju Deval Temple. The Unesco World Heritage Site was built in 1690. The only silver lining was that the earthquake occurred on a Saturday, which means that children were not at school. The irony is that just a week ago, 50 earthquake and social scientists from around the world had arrived at Kathmandu to help prepare the congested city for a big tremor. Seismologist James Jackson, the lead scientist for Earthquakes without Frontiers who experienced the earthquake firsthand, says Physically and geologically what happened is exactly what we thought would happen. The only thing the experts miscalculated was the timing! They had not anticipated a big one this soon. While not much can be done about what happened, the world is now rushing to do whatever it can to help the people of Nepal. In addition to the typical aid relief from the Red Cross and countries all over the world, corporations like Google and Facebook are using their worldwide reach to help connect loved ones. Wireless services provider T-Mobile and Internet calling company Viber, have waived fees for all calls and texts to and from Nepal. While it will take the country some time to recover, the new Nepal will hopefully comprise of safer structures, ones that can withstand even the most severe tremors. Nepals position at the junction of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates, the collision of which resulted in the Himalayas, is the reason the country is prone to earthquakes. As the Indian plate continues to push north toward Asia, it rubs against the Eurasian plate. This generates stress and energy that builds up until the earths crust finally ruptures. To make matters worse, Nepal sits on a thrust fault. Unlike normal faults that create space when the ground cracks, thrust faults cause the tectonic plates to force themselves atop one another. This results in extremely severe movements. According the Hongfend Yang, an earthquake expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Saturdays massive earthquake resulted in the Indian plate jumping forward by a stunning 2 meters or 6.5 feet! 
Tweens	The government is lowering the recommended amount of fluoride in drinking water. That's because some kids are getting too much. It is causing white splotches on their teeth.It's the first change since the government urged cities to add fluoride to water supplies to prevent tooth decay. That was more than 50 years ago. Now, fluoride is put in toothpaste, mouthwash and other products as well.One study found about 2 out of 5 adolescents had tooth streaking or spottiness. It's primarily a cosmetic issue, said Deputy Surgeon General Boris Lushniak.The mineral fluoride is in water and soil. About 70 years ago, scientists discovered that people whose drinking water naturally had more fluoride also had fewer cavities.Grand Rapids, Michigan became the world's first city to add fluoride to its drinking water. That was in 1945. Six years later, a study found a dramatic decline in tooth decay among children there. Then the U.S. surgeon general endorsed water fluoridation.Today, about 75 percent of Americans get fluoridated water.But adding fluoride was, and has remained, controversial. Opponents argue its health effects aren't completely understood. They say adding it amounts to an unwanted medication.Portland, Oregon voters rejected a proposal to add fluoride two years ago. This year, Sheridan, Wyoming resumed adding fluoride. The city stopped in 1953 after a referendum.Water fluoridation has been a public health success. Communities should keep adding fluoride, said Kathleen O'Loughlin, the American Dental Association's executive.Lushniak added: "It is the best method for delivering fluoride to all members of the community."Since 1962, the government has recommended a range of 0.7 milligrams per liter for warmer climates where people drink more water. In cooler areas, they recommended 1.2 milligrams. The new standard is 0.7 everywhere.Recent unpublished federal research found there's no regional differences in the amount of water kids drink. So it makes sense for the same levels to be used everywhere, health officials said.To limit fluoride for young children, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers this advice. Don't use fluoride toothpaste for children under 2 unless recommended by a dentist. Use only a pea-sized amount of toothpaste for children 2 through 6. And avoid fluoride mouthwash.
Tweens	In the days after a crushing earthquake hit the country of Nepal on April 25, there is still time to save lives.  Many governments and aid agencies are sending doctors, volunteers and equipment. They aren't waiting for the dust to settle. The estimates are that thousands of people have been killed. No one knows how many are injured or without food.U.N. spokeswoman Orla Fagan said preventing the spread of disease is one of the most important tasks facing aid workers. Nepal is between India and Tibet. It is home to Mount Everest, the world's largest mountain and part of the Himalayas. An avalanche caused by the quake killed some climbers on the mountain."There are 14 international medical teams on the way and either 14 or 15 international search-and-rescue teams on the way," Fagan said. "They need to get in as soon as possible. They will use military aircraft to get them into Nepal."Diarrhea was already a growing problem. A measles outbreak was feared. Vaccines are in short supply, the U.N. warned in a report.Substantial logistical hurdles remain. But there were hopeful signs as Kathmandu's international airport reopened. There were still delays as aftershocks continued. Some aid vehicles were able to travel over land from India to the stricken Nepalese city of Pokhara."That means supplies could potentially come in over land from India. That is a positive sign," said Ben Pickering, Save the Children's humanitarian adviser in Britain. "The airport opening is a small miracle."He cautioned that chaotic conditions may create a bottleneck at the airport. That could occur as governments and aid agencies try to bring in personnel and supplies.The need is great. UNICEF said Sunday that nearly 1 million children in areas affected by the earthquake are in "urgent need" of humanitarian assistance. UNICEF staff reported dwindling water supplies, power shortages and communications breakdowns.Celebrities like singer Shakira sent tweets appealing for help for UNICEF. The mobile payment company Square created a "cashtag" to donate: cash.me/$unicef. PayPal announced it was waiving fees for donations to several aid organizations.Information was still lacking about conditions at the earthquake's epicenter, Pickering said."Going forward it's about access to the epicenter and helicopters are the key," Pickering said. He added that Save the Children has emergency kits pre-positioned in three warehouses in Nepal. The organization plans to distribute bedding, buckets and other basic supplies to 2,000 families as quickly as possible.Other charities face similar roadblocks.International Search and Rescue Germany said a team of 52 relief workers including doctors, experts trained in searching for people buried under rubble and several dog squads were being flown in. The team will bring a mobile medical treatment center.Spokesman Stefan Heine said the priority was to get to the scene of the quake as quickly as possible. The goal is to find those still alive.They will be supported by numerous governments that have announced plans to send aid worth millions of dollars.A U.S. military plane departed Sunday morning for Nepal carrying 70 personnel. The group included a U.S. Agency for International Development disaster assistance response team. An urban search-and-rescue team from Fairfax, Virginia and 45 tons of cargo were also on board. California was sending a team of 57 urban search-and-rescue workers.The United Arab Emirates deployed an 88-member search-and-rescue team to Nepal. The Emirates Red Crescent also sent a team.The Israeli military said it is sending a 260-member mission. The group will provide immediate search-and-rescue help and medical aid. The mission includes approximately 95 tons of humanitarian and medical supplies and a medical staff of 122 doctors, nurses and paramedics. European nations deployed as well. France said it would send 11 rescuers on Sunday. Britain announced that an advance team of eight had been sent and that a $7.6 million aid package would be available. Italy deployed a team of experts from its Civil Protection Department as well as it foreign crisis team. The Swiss Foreign Ministry said a team of experts including a doctor, a building surveyor and water quality technician had left for Nepal.Poland is sending a rescue team of 81 firefighters. The country is providing heavy equipment and several dogs, as well several medics. The firefighters were delayed by aftershocks and confusion at Kathmandu's airport, said Pawel Fratczak, spokesman for firefighters.Canada sent an advance unit from its urban disaster search and rescue team. The unit includes medical personnel and humanitarian relief supplies.Volunteers from various British charities gathered at London's Heathrow Airport. They prepared for flights to the Nepal region. Gary Francis is the leader of the Search and Rescue Assistance in Disasters group. He said the organization was bringing in enough tents, food and water to operate self-sufficiently for 15 days.They were bringing in "a vast array" of equipment. It included sound and vibration detectors, seismic listening devices and cutting equipment. Their goal would be to find survivors. U.N. humanitarian chief Valerie Amos said "entire areas have been flattened." She said time is very important in search-and-rescue efforts.
Tweens	A celebrity mountain lion that lounged under a home for hours and refused to budge despite bean bags, tennis balls and prods has wandered out on its own, wildlife officials said.A thorough check turned up no sign of the big cat. It is known as P-22 and was found under a residence in the hilly Los Feliz neighborhood. That's near Los Angeles. This was according to Lt. J.C. Healy of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.Officials from the National Park Service were trying to pick up a signal from the electronic beacon on the cougar's collar to determine its whereabouts.Homeowner Rachel Archinaco told television station KABC that workers had been installing a home security system. They encountered the cougar in a crawl space."The one worker came sprinting through our house, white-faced, shouting, 'There's a mountain lion under your house!'" she said.The wild mountain lion, which has a red ear tag, normally lives in Griffith Park. It is right next to the neighborhood that features hillsides covered in thick brush. The animal arrived in the area several years ago. It came from the western slopes of the Santa Monica Mountains. The mountain lion crossed two freeways to get there.National Geographic famously photographed P-22 in 2013 with the Hollywood sign in the background. Several sharp photographs from a remote camera in Griffith Park captured the cat last year.He survived mange and a meal of rat poison last year to become apparently healthy again.At the home, wildlife officials cleared most media and gawkers away after darkness fell. Then they used several techniques that would not injure the animal to try to get him to leave. Trying to get the mountain lion to move on was handled by professionals. Gently, they poked him with a long prod. That did little other than temporarily lose the pricey GoPro camera they had attached to the end of it.They fired a tennis ball cannon into the crawl space. The idea was that the noise and commotion would scare him out. It's a tactic that often works with coyotes.They then fired small bean bags, the same kind police sometimes use for human crowd control, toward the cat. The mountain lion seemed unimpressed. All the tactics, shown live on streaming video, drew mild reactions from P-22. None came close to drawing him out. They didn't even get him to move much.Archinaco's husband, Jason, said the couple has three ordinary house cats. The family had thought about adding to their numbers."My wife wanted a fourth one," he said, "but not this way."
Tweens	You asked us, how do vaccines work? Well, vaccines are basically a stupendously brilliant way to train ourselves to fight some downright nasty, even deadly diseases.Let me explain.When we get sick from viruses or bacteria, our immune system creates weapons that attack the invading germs, but every disease is a little different, so we need to develop unique ammo for each one.And that can take time, which we don't always have, because some infections work fast and furious, never really giving us a chance to defend ourselves and the results can be deadly. The genius of vaccines is that they get our bodies to prep defense strategies without us having to actually get sick. Many do it by carrying a weaker or dead version of the germ, just enough to signal to our body to go on the attack, but not so much that an infection flares up.Our immune system then remembers the strategy for each defense, so if you ever come face to face with the real thing, we can get the upper hand by quickly pulling together a deadly strike force of our own. Many vaccines provide lifelong protection and though none is 100% effective, the more people in a population that get vaccinated the more we're able to control diseases. Thanks to vaccines smallpox is a thing of the past.Go science!For more stories like this, check us out every day at smithsonian.com.Go science, it's your birthday. Go science, it's your birthday.
Tweens	The most familiar mummies are the Egyptians, buried in elaborate tombs and surrounded with treasures to escort them into the afterlife.But not all mummies were Egyptian,  or even of the ruling class.Mummies have been found around the world, in circumstances ranging from honored leaders to unfortunate victims.What makes a mummy is its resistance to natural decay. Mummies are bodies that have preserved for long periods of time, either because people prepared them to last or because natural conditions caused accidental preservation.Each mummy is a time capsule that speaks to us from the past.Anthropologists who study mummies gather data from the skeleton as well as the clothing, jewelry, coffin or other accessories.These artifacts provide cultural context that might reveal how the person lived and died.These days, scientists try to peer inside mummies without destroying the linen strips or other materials wrapping the body or the body itself. X-rays are used to see the skeletal structure, while CT Scans can show soft tissues in three dimensions.Find out more about how scientists unravel the mysteries of mummies by joining us on Thursday, May 7, 2015, for a "Smithsonian Science How" live webcast titled Mummy Science – Natural and Cultural Preserved Remains, airing at 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. EDT on the Q?rius website.Dr. David Hunt from the Physical Anthropology Division at the National Museum of Natural History will appear live to discuss and answer questions.You can get teaching resources to support your webcast experience.
Tweens	Think Jaws meets a kangaroo, with maybe a touch of cute kitten and you've got the aptly named pocket shark, the newest and rarest species found off the U.S. coast.Surprised scientists found a tiny, young version of the extraordinarily rare shark that was fished out of the deep Gulf of Mexico in 2010 with lots of other creatures in a government research trip. The dead specimen spent more than three years in a giant freezer waiting to be identified.It turned out to be only the second of its species ever seen. The first pocket shark was found 36 years ago in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Peru and it's been sitting in a Russian museum ever since.This pocket shark was a male, maybe a few weeks old, about 5.5 inches long. Strangely, this type of shark has two pockets next to its front fins; their purpose is not known. It's not quite like a kangaroo, which uses its pouch to carry young, but few species have pockets this large — about 4 percent of the shark's body."It's cute," said Tulane University biologist Michael Doosey, who co-authored a study in a zoological journal identifying the shark. "It almost looks like a little whale."National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration fisheries biologist Mark Grace has spent more than 30 years going through bags upon bags of fish to identify them. It took him more than three years to get near the end of the freezer, when he plopped a bag on the table and let it thaw."I wasn't really sure what it was," Grace said. "That pocket over on the pectoral fin, I had never seen anything like that on a shark."It's a small miracle that the shark was not thrown away because a couple of times, the lab with the freezer lost power.Once identified, the shark was shipped to New York and France for high-tech examinations that wouldn't puncture the specimen.The shark also has unusual belly patches not seen in most sharks. The only other pocket shark was a female adult about 17 inches long; it is believed that adult females may be larger than males.But the truly strange thing about this species is its twin pockets. While no one knows what they are for, Grace and Doosey speculated that they may secrete some kind of glowing fluid or pheromones.The Gulf specimen has umbilical scars, showing he's probably a few weeks old, Grace said. Because of that, they think he was born in the Gulf. He was captured in February 2010 by the ship Pisces about 190 miles off the Louisiana coast."There's others" out there, Grace said. "We just haven't caught them yet."
Tweens	After nearly 100 years, the National Park Service holds some of the country's most beautiful and historic places. It also suffers from an $11 billion backlog of unfunded maintenance. And visitors are aging and mostly white.The park service's centennial is approaching. In 2016, it will mark 100 years. The park service is launching a campaign to raise support and court a younger, more diverse visitor base. First lady Michelle Obama and former first lady Laura Bush will co-chair the campaign. Americans will be called upon to "Find Your Park."Sustaining the parks and keeping them relevant to visitors far into the future is a challenge. Many facilities date back 50 years or more. Some are in danger of failing, such as a 70-year-old water pipeline at the at the Grand Canyon. That could cut off the water supply to the site, National Park Service Director Jonathan Jarvis said. Lodging at Glacier National Park needs a major overhaul. The nearly 100-year-old Memorial Bridge in Washington needs at least $150 million in repairs. That's more than the agency's entire annual construction budget.Behind the scenes, officials are seeking to expand fundraising through the National Park Foundation. They also want to bolster congressional support to improve the parks.This is the third major campaign in the national parks' history. The deplorable park conditions in 1915 originally led to the creation of the National Park Service. In the 1950s, there were calls to close parks because of their neglected conditions. That inspired a campaign to rebuild infrastructure and invite returning World War II veterans and their families to visit parks. The memorable slogan "See the USA in your Chevrolet" was created."They came in droves,"  Jarvis said of today's baby boomer generation. "They are our base today... The question that we're facing is who's going to be the next generation of park supporters."However, there is a problem. Those visitors tend to be older and whiter than the U.S. population overall."If we were a business and that was our clientele, then over the long term, we would probably be out of business," Jarvis said.In studying public perceptions, park officials found many people think national parks are only in the West. That's where Yellowstone and Yosemite are located. The officials want people to understand that urban sites also are national parks. A few of those include the Statue of Liberty, Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Little Rock, Ark., Central High School and the Lincoln Memorial in Washington.Over the next year, an advertising campaign will show how people connect with their favorite parks. There are corporate sponsors including American Express, REI and Humana that are also supporting the effort.To broaden access to the parks, all fourth grade students and their families will get free admission to national parks during the next school year.Celebrities are getting involved, too. The science guy Bill Nye, actresses Bella Thorne and Roselyn Sanchez, E! News anchor Terrence J. and singer Mary Lambert are urging millennials to put down their smartphones for time in parks.President Barack Obama requested an increase of $432 million to support the National Park Service in his 2016 budget proposal. It's a request that would lift the agency's budget to $3 billion annually. The money would address deferred maintenance and other needs. It likely will face resistance in Congress.During a recent hearing, Republican Rep. Tom McClintock of California said Congress must ensure the parks are well maintained. But he said the park service is plagued by "a clash of visions." The issue is between open access and new policies limiting access or amenities in some areas. He said the agency should be cautious about naming new parks. He wants the current parks to be fixed first. A campaign is under way. The goal is to raise hundreds of millions of dollars to rebuild historic infrastructure with private funds. Campaign planners hope public support will also help build congressional support.Interior Secretary Sally Jewell put the issue bluntly."If we don't reach out and become relevant to a broader population, we won't have the support the parks need to do their jobs in the future."
Tweens	The nation's biggest city, New York, is announcing the ambitious goal of reducing its waste output by 90 percent by 2030.The plan includes an overhaul of the city's recycling program. It includes incentives to reduce waste. It also includes tacit support for the City Council's plan to dramatically reduce the use of plastic shopping bags. It was announced by Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio. The announcement came on Earth Day, which was April 22.New York has about 8.5 million residents. It would be the largest city in the Western Hemisphere to adopt such a plan. Its aim is to reduce the amount of the city's waste by more than 3 million tons from its 2005 level. That was about 3.6 million tons.The waste reduction plan is part of an update to the project created by de Blasio's predecessor, Michael Bloomberg. De Blasio is keeping its components but rebranding it OneNYC.The average New Yorker throws out nearly 15 pounds of waste a week. That adds up to millions of tons a year, de Blasio said in a statement to The Associated Press. "To be a truly sustainable city, we need to tackle this challenge head on."For decades, the city's trash has been exported by rail or barge. It is sent to South Carolina, Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania or upstate New York. The new plan would eliminate almost all of the garbage exports. They cost the city more than $350 million a year.The amount of waste produced by the city has fallen 14 percent since 2005. That is due to an increase in recycling. A key component of the plan is to bolster that output by simplifying the process.Currently, residential buildings have two types of recycling bins. The city's new single-stream plan would consolidate all recycling into one bin by 2020.Organics — such as food scraps and yard waste — make up 31 percent of the city's residential waste stream. A program to collect that material directly from residents' homes is being expanded. The goal is to reach nearly 200,000 residents by year's end. Officials want to serve every home in the city by the end of 2018. The city also will offer economic incentives to participate. The incentives could eventually include a property tax rebate for homeowners.The city also aims to reduce commercial waste by 90 percent by 2030. It would adopt a program similar to what is being used in residential buildings. That could also mean tax incentives for businesses that participate. Those that don't take part could be fined.The de Blasio administration stopped short of endorsing a City Council bill. It proposes a 10-cent fee on plastic bags. Officials said that reducing their use is a priority.The OneNYC presentation is meant to build on de Blasio's environmental record. That includes a ban on Styrofoam boxes. The goal is to reduce carbon emissions from city buildings by 80 percent by 2050.Environmental groups applauded the plan's wide-ranging scope."We see cities all over the world struggling with waste," said Michael Berkowitz. He is president of 100 Resilient Cities. "A more efficient city is a more resilient city. And that means it's a stronger city."
Tweens	Scientists are getting their best look yet at the DNA code for the woolly mammoth, work that could be a step toward bringing back the extinct beast.Researchers deciphered the complete DNA code, or genomes, of two mammoths. The new genomes are far more refined than a previous one announced, in 2008. DNA determines what traits a living organism will have.One new genome comes from a mammoth that lived about 45,000 years ago in northeastern Siberia. The other comes from a creature that lived about 4,300 years ago on Russia's Wrangel Island in the Arctic Circle.The results were announced in a paper released by the journal Current Biology. The DNA was extracted from a tooth and a sample of soft tissue.Woolly mammoths were about as big as modern African elephants and they sport long curved tusks and thick hairy coats. They are the best-known species of mammoth. The information comes from frozen and often well-preserved carcasses in Siberia.The Wrangel Island population was the last of the creatures to go extinct. Some scientists have suggested that mammoths could be created anew through genetic engineering, an idea not everybody favors.Love Dalen of the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm, an author of the new study, said re-creating mammoths is not a goal of his research team and he's also "very uncertain" that it's even possible.Still, he wrote in an email, "Our genomes bring us one critical step closer to re-creating a mammoth .... I think it would be cool if it could be done, but I'm not sure it should be done."One ethical drawback, he said, is that elephants would be used as surrogate mothers to carry the genetically engineered mammoth embryos. That species mismatch might lead to problems that cause the mothers to suffer, he said.Hendrik Poinar of Canada's McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, who is another author of the study, said the new work "gives us at least a blueprint to work from."Poinar said mammoths could be a welcome addition if re-introduced to the wild, but if they were made just for exhibition at zoos, "I don't see any good in that at all."
Tweens	Streets in San Francisco's Tenderloin neighborhood are blocks away from the fancy stores and long lines of tourists waiting for cable cars. They are now cleaner since solar-powered toilets began rolling in.The mobile bathrooms on wheels are guarded by attendants. The bathrooms have been so successful that city officials say Portland, Oregon, Honolulu and New York have inquired about them. The cities are seeking solutions for similar sanitation problems.Supporters of the portable pit stops say having public bathrooms accessible has made the neighborhood more livable. The area has been known for crime, homelessness and poverty."Everyone has to go to the bathroom. That's not something anyone can stop," said Jane Kim. She is a San Francisco supervisor whose district includes the Tenderloin neighborhood. "This program affords people some dignity to take care of a human need."Two portable toilets with sinks mounted on a trailer are hauled in by pickup trucks. They are moved in each Tuesday through Friday. They are placed in three spots near soup kitchens and park areas that attract large clusters of people. They are dropped off at 2 p.m. and taken out at 9 p.m. to be cleaned.Attendants working for a nonprofit contracted by the city make sure the portable toilets stay sanitary. They keep them stocked with toilet paper, air freshener, soap, paper towels and seat covers. They also give users a courtesy knock after five minutes.Kaven Harris, 54, said before the toilets were brought in, he was forced to go to the bathroom in parking lots. He would hide between cars."If this pit stop weren't here, I would be in a parking lot," said Harris. He is an Army veteran who has been living on the streets about six months. "There is no place to use the bathroom if you're homeless and don't have money."The pilot program was inspired by a group of students at De Marillac Academy. It is a private Catholic school in the neighborhood. They read poems to city officials about their struggles growing up in the Tenderloin neighborhood."You had to be cautious and you had to be looking at the floor to make sure you didn't step on poop," student Karina Bonilla, 14, said. "But not anymore!"On a recent afternoon, an attendant locked the bathrooms when there were no customers. The attendant swept the nearby area.The success of the pilot program is largely due to the employees who make sure the bathrooms are not misused. That has happened with other public bathrooms, said Mohammed Nuru. He is the city's public works department director."We have seen huge success with staffing these facilities and making them decent for people," Nuru said.Since the program started in July, requests to cleaning feces and urine off of sidewalks also have dropped by a third. The requests have gone from an average of 27 calls per weekday to about 15, Nuru said.There are plans to set up more mobile bathrooms in other neighborhoods. Each costs the city about $100,000 per year per station. Officials have to allocate funds first. There are also plans to assign attendants to the 25 automated public bathrooms first installed 20 years ago throughout the city. They are so dirty that they are rarely used for their original purpose, Nuru said."The streets have been cleaner and smells aren't so bad," said Britney Pirring, a 13-year-old student at De Marillac Academy. "Now my brother and I can take our time on the streets walking to school."
Researchers	This is a study of teachers’ visions. Five participants were followed through their pre-service years in the teacher education program and into their first year of teaching to see if their vision was sustained and whether it appeared in their practice. This paper describes the coding process for visions and discusses changes that occurred in the visions as participants made the transition from pre-service to in-service teachers. The paper discusses dissonance between visions and practice and presents implications for teacher educators. As a teacher educator, I continually explore how to more successfully prepare high-quality reading teachers who not only know how to teach reading effectively but also possess a vision of their practice and reading instruction. Teacher visioning is a concept in teacher education that has garnered significant attention from teacher education and literacy scholars in recent years (Bransford, Derry, Berliner, Hammerness, & Beckett, 2005; Duffy, 2002; Fairbanks, Duffy, Faircloth, He, Levin, Rohr, & Stein, 2010; Gambrell, Malloy, & Mazzoni, 2011; Hammerness, 2006; Kennedy, 2006; Shulman & Shulman, 2004; Vaughn & Faircloth, 2011). Visions are images of ideal practice that guide teachers’ instructional decision-making and provide them with a touchstone for measuring their pedagogical efforts (Hammerness, 2006; Shulman & Shulman, 2004). Research on visioning that follows pre-service teachers into their in-service years is currently limited to two studies: Rattigan-Rohr (2005) and Hammerness (2006). Rattigan-Rohr studied prospective teachers’ initial and final vision statements during their introductory teaching class in their sophomore year prior to declaring education as their major. She found that the majority of prospective teachers did not have visions for teaching when entering the introductory class, and their visions seem to be shaped by the course experiences, particularly by the field experience component of the course. Rattigan-Rohr categorized visions as being moral or intellectual, based on the existing literature. Hammerness followed student teachers into their first few years of teaching and reported the focus of the visions and the influence of the visions’ attainability on teaching. She found the distance between vision and teaching context either sustained or led to discouragement with teaching. The attainable vision sustained and inspired teachers, while visions that were seemingly distant from reality or in opposition with mandates led to discouragement and career moves (Hammerness, 2006, 2008). As teacher educators, however, we have limited data regarding the sustainability of those visions, particularly those developed within teacher education programs. This article reports results from a longitudinal teacher education study that examines the visions of pre-service teachers in their junior and senior years through their first year of teaching. Problem This study examines whether pre-service teachers’ visions are enacted in the lessons they teach for literacy methods courses and whether their visions are sustained and enacted in literacy instruction during their first year of teaching. This study has implications for determining how teacher education influences teachers’ visions (Shulman & Shulman, 2004) and whether visions developed in pre-service education are sustained. Two questions propelled this study: 1. What is the focus of pre-service teachers’ visions? 2. How are pre-service teachers’ visions evident in their reflections on the teaching of literacy and in their first year of teaching? Theorizing Teacher Vision Over the past several years, teacher visioning has garnered significant scholarly attention (Bransford et al., 2005; Fairbanks et al., 2010; Gambrell, Malloy, & Mazzoni, 2011; Hammerness, 2006; 2008; Kennedy, 2006; Shulman & Shulman, 2004; Vaughn & Faircloth, 2011). Researchers have defined a “vision” in teaching in several different ways; however, a common theme emerges. Briefly, theorists present a vision as a source that inspires teachers and guides their classroom instruction (Duffy, 2002; Gambrell, Malloy, & Mazzoni, 2011; Feiman-Nemser, 2001; Hammerness et al., 2005; Hansen, 2001; Lampert, 2001; Shulman & Shulman, 2004). Rattigan-Rohr (2005) pulled from the research literature to define a teacher’s vision as a personal moral compass directing teachers to shape their practice and to act in ways they believe will positively benefit students. Possessing a vision, therefore, is an individual teacher’s commitment to a morality that goes beyond traditional curricular goals and acknowledges that teaching children also includes a responsibility to develop larger understandings and attitudes. Duffy (2005) calls vision a “moral compass” because visions create a conscious awareness of how teachers wish to touch the future. Similarly, theorists describe the call to teach as a mindset through which teachers create a vision of who they are and by which they make decisions to engage in constructivist or other forms of highly engaged teaching (Gambrell, Malloy, & Mazzoni, 2011; Garrison, 1997; Shulman & Shulman, 2004). Garrison (1997) argues that outstanding teachers not only answer the call to teach but that they “become this call…with persistence and care” (p. 74). In addition to a moral purpose, researchers conclude that the exceptional teacher also develops a vision with a strong intellectual purpose; this teacher develops a vision that seeks to create conditions that will stir children’s capabilities to achieve enhanced learning (Cuffaro, 1995; Gambrell, Malloy, & Mazzoni, 2011). Also, effective teachers are most often the ones who can be found working hard to ensure that their classroom practices are securely rooted in intellectual honesty and integrity (Ball, 1993; Lampert, 2001). As a matter of course, visionary teachers appear to be constantly seeking to find new and different ways to help their students learn and grow (Gambrell, Malloy, & Mazzoni, 2011). They know that finding new strategies and methods requires both growing and the “letting go” of favorite and long-accustomed techniques (Hammerness et al., 2005). We understand then that teachers with visions work hard to ensure their students are able to acquire insights into themselves and their world. Wood, Nelson, and Warfield (2001) lamented what they saw as the deficiency of an intellectual focus and the lack of movement toward a “well-articulated vision” by many teachers of mathematics (p. 12). They noted their view of the benefits of an intellectual vision for the development of mathematics instruction. In such a vision, teachers would focus the teaching on understanding and reasoning, and on high standards of achievement. They also noted, however, that in classrooms where this kind of well-articulated intellectual vision is missing, low-level instruction continues to dominate. A Vygotskian social constructivist perspective serves as a theory underlying how visions develop. Learning is more fully facilitated in the social context (Vygotsky, 1981). That is, pre-service teachers have had their entire career as students to observe teachers at work, a process Lortie (1975) labeled “apprenticeship of observation” (p. 61). Therefore, whatever understanding pre-service teachers construct about their developing visions has two components: (a) the thoughts or mindset they brought with them to the teacher education program, and (b) some possible adjustments and/or additions to those thoughts based upon what they learned in the social environment of the teacher education program. A fundamental idea to this Vygotskian social constructivist perspective is the concept of the zone of proximal development (ZPD) (Vygotsky, 1978). According to Vygotsky, the ZPD is the space between what one actually knows and what one potentially could know, as determined through problem solving under the influence of a more knowledgeable person. Therefore, the development of preservice teachers’ visions is likely influenced by contacts with various perspectives, presented to them within their ZPD, including information from readings, contact with teachers in field experiences, discussions about visions, interactions with peers, and other teacher education activities. The expectation from this line of reasoning is that pre-service teachers link social and external interactions to their own internal developing visions for teaching (Forman & Cazden, 1985), which influences their thinking (Hughes, 1958). In the pre-service years, students wrote a vision statement upon beginning a new semester in the teacher education program. After readings, lectures, discussions, and field experiences, students continued to refine and refocus their vision statements. Consequently, pre-service teachers revised and refined their vision statements multiple times over two years. 
Researchers	Professional development school partnerships can improve teaching and learning in our schools. To support these partnerships, the National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) developed standards for professional development schools. In this article, we address the questions, “What NCATE standards work from the point of view of school principals and university faculty members when sustaining PDS partnerships?” and “How can universities improve PDS implementations so that all partners see the benefit of each NCATE standard?” Although, there is wide agreement between school leaders and university faculty on the importance of the standards, there are also some notable differences in their functionality. There is no doubt that a “fully functioning” professional development school (PDS) partnership can improve teaching and learning in our schools (Darling-Hammond, 2005; The Holmes Partnership, 2006; Levine, 2006; Tetiel, 2004; Van Scoy & Eldridge, 2012). These improvements manifest themselves in a variety of ways including, improved student achievement, powerful professional development opportunities for classroom teachers, and unique opportunities for undergraduate teacher candidates to learn their craft in a nurturing environment (Darling-Hammond & Baratz-Snowden, 2005; NCATE, 2006). School principals, district leaders, and university professors have opportunities to create meaningful partnerships that enhance both the school district and the university. However, building and sustaining quality professional development schools can be a challenge. Turnover in district and school-based leadership, changing areas of focus by universities or state policymakers, and limited financial and human resources can all place stress on a partnership. Having clear partnership expectations and lines of communication between the professional development school and the collaborating university are key to sustaining a meaningful partnership (Doolittle, Sudeck & Rattigan, 2008). The National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) has developed standards for professional development schools (Table 1) that have been broadly accepted in the educational community (NCATE, 2001a). These standards are important in several ways. First and foremost, the standards address the essential characteristics (critical attributes) of a PDS (Brindley, Field, & Lessen, 2008). Second, the standards have been instrumental in bringing about a general consensus within the profession regarding the definition of a professional development school. Third, the standards are designed to accommodate the developmental nature of PDS partnerships and include guidelines meant to support PDS development and implementation across various levels. Finally, the standards provide a common framework across partnerships for investigating PDS outcomes, assessing PDS quality, and promoting continued partnership development through self-study (NCATE, 2001b). 
Researchers	An abundance of research confirms preservice teachers are unprepared to work with diverse populations. This article describes an education program’s efforts to support diversity initiatives and provide information and hands-on training to prepare teacher candidates for future work with the diversity they will encounter. Explanations of programs, coursework, professional development, and current and supportive literature are included. Introduction Imagine a world where all teachers are comfortable working with all students. They are prepared to meet the needs of every child based on academic abilities, physical and emotional constraints, and cultural, religious and domestic backgrounds. Imagine a world where classrooms are equipped with the necessities that provide for the ultimate learning experience for all children. They are filled with books from all cultures, in many languages; pictures representative of all people; manipulative materials to fit all hands; and decorations and wall art that is inviting to every individual. Imagine a world where all children can go to school unafraid, excited, and knowing they will be treated equally. Imagine a world where parents feel comfortable entering their child’s school, talking to their child’s teachers, and being involved in the education of the whole. We call ourselves simply The Diversity Committee for our University’s School of Education. While we cannot expect to make the description above a reality, we can and have worked toward that vision in our own smaller community. Our mission is to 1) cultivate and continuously improve a curriculum that will engage all faculty members as diversity responsive professionals, 2) pre-pare all teacher candidates to function effectively in diverse classrooms, and 3) develop and nurture a relationship with partner schools and other university education programs that strive to promote diversity awareness and education. Sonia Nieto (2006) shares a list of qualities (beyond those research reveals) that she believes good teachers should possess. They are 1) “a sense of mission,” 2) “solidarity with, and empathy for, their students,” 3) “the courage to challenge main-stream knowledge,” 4) “improvisation,” and 5) “a passion for social justice” (p. 463). Wong et al. (2007) state “teacher quality must be defined beyond the parameters of content knowledge to include a teacher’s ability to create optimal learning environments for students marginalized by the system because of their primary language, race/ethnicity, social class, culture, gender, and ability” (p. 10). Greta Freeman, Marilyn Izzard, Rebecca Faulkner & Jim Charles The Professional Educator This paper provides a general outline of our committee’s work with teacher candidates, colleagues, and PK–12 schools to promote diversity awareness and responsive teaching. It specifically breaks down best practice program initiatives we have found successful. We strive to promote quality teaching from a research standpoint: knowledge of subject matter; good communication and organizational skills; and training in educational pedagogy. Yet, we embrace those additional qualities listed by Nieto to help our teacher practitioners and professionals grow their knowledge, attitudes, and skills for working with a diverse student population. We make every effort to produce quality teachers as defined by Wong et al., to be knowledgeable in content and all-encompassing of diversity. School of Education Unit Diversity Plan Nichols and Dong (2011) make a bold statement when they say, “The majority of today’s American pre-service teachers just simply do not understand what multi-cultural education is” (p. 6). They go on to challenge education programs to “better prepare their students for teaching the multicultural student populations they will undoubtedly encounter” (p. 6). We believe, as a committee, our education unit is prepared to take this challenge. Our committee begins each academic year by updating our “unit diversity plan,” which one can access at http://www.uscupstate. edu/academics/education/default.aspx?id=2489. This plan focuses on diversity initiatives for teacher candidates, faculty, partner schools, and the unit as a whole. Nichols and Dong follow some important researchers in the area of multicultural education with their prescriptions for education programs. Ladson-Billings (2001), Gay (2002), Banks and McGee Banks (2004) and Cochran-Smith and Zeichner (2005) have all called for change and/or better preparation in multicultural teacher education. In keeping with this standard, the following list describes activities integrated into our curriculum and supported by our diversity committee and unit diversity plan. Course Assignments Each year, course instructors update a unit Excel chart detailing diversity-related content for all education program courses. We ensure inclusion of diversity related topics in the majority of our program coursework. Teacher Work Sample Diverse Learner Project As a part of the required teacher work sample portfolio implemented during the student teaching semester, preservice teachers are required to follow and work with a student from a diverse background. This can include racial, ethnic, cultural, socioeconomic, or other differences. They then report and reflect on the experience in the work sample portfolio. SEDF 483 – Organization and Management of a Diverse Classroom This course is specifically designed to detail practices supporting instruction in a diverse classroom. All teacher candidates are required to take this course the semester before student teaching. www.teachdiversity.org This website, a collaborative effort between USC Upstate and Furman University Education programs, “identifies resources for teaching and managing diversity in the classroom.” It is valuable for teacher candidates, teachers in the field, and university faculty in that it provides valuable School of Education Diversity Initiatives Volume 36, No. 1 • Spring, 2012 diversity-related resources such as lesson plans and links to other websites. This website is shared with our public school partners and “seeks to help educators prepare for the next generation to deal positively with the opportunities and challenges that diversity affords.” Field Experiences Dunn et al. (2009) advocate “faculties of education aim to ensure that all teacher candidates take part in field experiences that involve working in communities with diverse populations” (p. 553). Early field experiences and student teaching are essential parts of our programs. We have developed relationships with schools allowing us to place our teacher candidates in classrooms for observation and practice teaching. We also offer some of our courses on the K–12 school campuses. Our teacher candidates are placed in schools each semester after being admitted to the professional program. The field experience director makes certain they are placed in rural, urban, and high poverty schools for one or more of their placements. The teacher candidate population in our education program is approximately 70% Caucasian. During the senior year, our elementary education teacher candidates are placed in two very different schools for approximately 100 hours of field work: One school is predominately African American; the other is predominately of Hispanic culture. The response from the prestudent teachers is overwhelmingly positive. Diversity Conference This one-day event for student teachers from USC Upstate and other South Carolina college and university education programs is a forum for sharing ideas and activities for supporting diversity. The conference, formally called the Diversity Collaborative, brings together future teachers from various cultural backgrounds to learn from professionals in the field and one another. The event is described in detail later in this paper. 
Researchers	Current reform efforts seek to redesign teacher education in alignment with a practice-based theory, a fundamental reconceptualization of higher education demanding a tighter alignment with K-12 school practices. The Faculty Research Residency Model—a Department of Education Funds for the Improvement of PostSecondary Education (FIPSE) grant supported project—draws upon practice-based theory and leverages existing school-university partnerships to create opportunities for faculty to research practices in high need urban schools to inform university course redesign. This study describes the faculty research residency model, reports on year one results of the project, describes implications for refining the model, and provides recommendations to inform others seeking to improve university coursework through school-university partnerships. Teacher education has come under fire for not preparing teacher candidates to enact rigorous and robust instruction, particularly to students of color or those living in poverty (Blanchett, 2006; Grant & Gillette, 2006; Ladson-Billings, 2005). Referred to as “the problem of enactment,” teacher candidates are frequently unable to translate theories of effective teaching and learning into practice—and thereby fail to promote rigorous and robust student learning (Hammerness et al., 2005). Currently, there is an effort to combat the problem of enactment by recommending a practice-based theory of teacher learning (Ball & Forzani, 2010; Lambert, 2010) that calls for a fundamental reconceptualization of how teacher education coursework is designed and delivered. To address problems of enactment occurring within our school-university partnership settings and improve the caliber of university curriculum and coursework using a practice-based approach, we designed the Faculty Research Residency (FRR) project. The FRR Project spans 2011–13 and is funded by a three-year Department of Education grant. The project was designed to improve teacher education, strengthen existing school partnerships, and create new ways for university faculty to learn in, with, and from the classroom or school context. In the FRR Project, university faculty are situated in high-need, urban schools to: 1) engage in a research project in their discipline to better understand and/or impact student learning; and 2) use the contextual knowledge gained from this in-depth experience to inform teacher preparation course redesign to more effectively prepare teacher candidates, which in turns supports our partnering network schools. University faculty also met in monthly seminars to discuss research on practice-based theory and collaborate on research and course redesign. This descriptive narrative reports on data reflecting the first year of the grant. The purpose of this study was to understand how faculty experienced and perceived the FRR project. In particular, we wanted to understand if the FRR project facilitated faculty research in high-need schools and contributed to curricular redesign utilizing a practice-based approach. This narrative describes the FRR Wendy Gardiner & Diane Salmon The Professional Educator project and provides lessons learned from year one to inform subsequent grant cycles and increase the likelihood that the grant will improve teaching and learning. This narrative is also intended to describe a model and collaborative process for engaging faculty in high-need schools to improve university coursework and respond to the pervasive problems of enactment that beginning teachers’ experience. Conceptual Framework Practice-Based Theory A practice-based theory for teacher learning demands a situated approach in which theory (which is typically generalized) is specifically linked to and embedded in the actual tasks and activities of teaching (Ball & Forzani, 2010; Hammerness et al., 2005; Lambert, 2010). A shift to a practice-based design in teacher learning requires that teacher educators deepen their participation within schools to redesign university learning to explicitly explore the nexus of theory and practice (Darling-Hammond, 2010; Wang et al., 2010). The outcome of tighter integration between theory and practice is better prepared teacher candidates who are more likely to overcome the challenges of “enactment” in complex classroom environments and ultimately improve student learning (Hammerness et al., 2005). Grossman and colleagues (2009) provide a framework that is assistive in thinking about redesigning coursework and restructuring teaching to reflect a practice-based theory. Drawn from a study of how beginning professionals best learn the core practices of their chosen profession, Grossman and colleagues identified three key and interrelated concepts to guide university teaching: representations, decomposition, and approximation of practice. Representations of practice are utilized to examine and analyze the visible and invisible aspects of a practice and help novices develop a more concrete and robust understanding of a given practice. Representations for teacher education often include case studies, examples of student work, lesson and unit plans, video, observation, and modeling a practice. When using representations of practice, an important role of the instructor is to help reveal the nuances that a novice would not observe, such as teacher thinking and decision making. Decomposition involves breaking down a complex practice into the constituent parts. Decomposition is used to isolate, identify, and then practice the different components of a core practice. Decomposition provides a process for scaffolding the development of a complex practice. Then, the practice is “recomposed” from component parts back to the whole. Examples of decomposed practice include focusing on specific elements of lesson plans such as practicing and analyzing lesson openings and closing; or identifying and practices different aspects of a read aloud such as reading with expression or asking engaging questions. Over time, the fully integrated, or “recomposed,” practice should become a routine. Approximations provide opportunities to enact a complex teaching practice outside of the K-12 classroom context. Practice opportunities in the university setting allow novices to implement a specific practice, such as guided reading, from start to finish without the added challenge of managing and responding to events that occur in a classroom of children, while also receiving targeted feedback on their performance. As such, approximations can help a novice feel more secure and steady in implementation prior to enacting a practice with a group or classroom of children. For teacher educators to apply a practice-based approach, they need to understand how the practices they teach are enacted in the field settings in which their teacher candidates are placed and understand the challenges of enactment. By developing a more contextualized and nuanced Research Residencies Volume 38, No. 1 • Spring, 2014 understanding, faculty are more likely to select and create the representations, decompositions, and approximations of practice that are more likely to improve teacher candidates’ learning and foster transfer. Yet, structural and cultural factors tend to inhibit faculty’s capacity to improve upon their coursework. 
Researchers	This paper presents findings from a study surveying student teachers (N = 128) from two universities who reported a significantly greater influence by university-based supervisors on their teaching when they had taken a class with the supervisor prior to student teaching. The student teachers were more likely to report implementing university teachings and using supervisors’ advice than if they had not taken a class with that supervisor. These findings have important implications as they suggest a greater transfer of learning from the university to the classroom, producing student teachers who are willing to incorporate and implement universitybased practices in a new context. The No Child Left Behind (NCLB) mandate for more highly qualified teachers has forced teacher preparation programs to reflect, rethink, and reform their methods for training new teachers. New or additional classes, higher standards, and increased numbers of standardized tests (e.g., Praxis exams) are all being implemented in an effort to develop stronger, more effective programs with the expectation of improving teacher quality and student achievement. Student teaching, often the culminating experience of preservice teachers’ education, allows students to connect research to practice in an authentic setting (Zeichner, 2002). Thus, strengthening the student teaching experience is viewed as a key component to improving teacher education. Ongoing partnerships with schools, full-year internships, pre-student teaching placements, and extended field experiences are among the efforts to reform and improve the student teaching experience (e.g., McKinney et al., 2008; Devlin-Scherer, Mitchel, & Mueller, 2007; Latham & Vogt, 2007). Additionally, in an effort to nurture and secure master cooperating teachers, education programs are attempting to raise the bar regarding who can qualify as a cooperating teacher. Prior research indicates that cooperating teachers are seen as the most important figure in student teaching because student teachers often emulate their cooperating teachers, even when the instructional methods conflict with what is taught at the university (Glenn, 2006; Koeppen, 1998; Metcalf, 1991; Su, 1992; Zheng & Webb, 2000). For example, Bates and Burbank note that “student teachers quickly accommodate to classroom practices…without considering the impact on student learning” (2008, p. 31). The student teachers often believe that the classroom teachers have “real” experience and know better than their university education faculty (Marks, 2002). The role and influence of the university supervisor within the student teaching process is frequently ignored or discounted, often by both the student teacher and the cooperating teacher (Marks, 2002). A lack of impact on the student teacher has led some researchers to imply that university supervisors are superfluous (Metcalf, 1991; Zeichner & Gore, 1990). Instead of providing additional insights and support, university supervisors are viewed as “inspectors” rather than collaborative Kristen N. Asplin & Melissa J. Marks The Professional Educator partners (Ongel, Capa, & Vellom, 2002) and are seen as less qualified than cooperating teachers to grade student teachers (Zheng & Webb, 2000). Research on improving communication among the triad of student teacher, university supervisor, and cooperating teacher, or balancing this triad’s power structure, has often indicated that the university supervisor is the weak link (Silva, 2000; Tsui et al., 2001; Wilder & Croker, 1999). The other side of the debate posits that university supervisors are very important in “supporting student teachers’ implementation of recent reforms and theories learned in coursework” (Fernandez & Erbilgin, 2009, p. 94). This transfer of learning from the university to the classroom can be impacted by university supervisors when: (a) a positive relationship exists between the student teacher and the supervisor; (b) the student teacher recognizes the supervisor’s expertise and professionalism; (c) the supervisor is accessible; and (d) the supervisor consistently holds the student teacher to university expectations as they are expressed in university education classes or in a student teacher handbook (Marks, 2002). Additionally, university supervisors appear to provide emotional support needed for student teachers to acclimate to the initial hurdles encountered in student teaching (Caires, Almeida, & Martins, 2010; Caires & Almeida, 2007). More generally, instructors fulfill a variety of roles that can influence student teachers. They serve as experts on course content, as learning facilitators, curriculum developers, mentors and role models, resource providers, and supporters and nurturers of students. An effective student-teacher relationship can have a pervasive impact on the social, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral lives of students. Student teachers considered their university supervisors’ “personal features,” including being supportive, non-judgmental, and helpful, to be essential to overcoming obstacles and maintaining their emotional balance during student teaching (Caires & Almeida, 2007). In clinical psychological research, the concept of therapeutic alliance suggests that the relationship between the counselor and the client is a key factor in the success of therapy (Krupnick et al., 1996). Similarly, the bond between instructor and student may enrich and influence the student’s life and may also lead to an increased amount of transfer from that instructor’s teaching to the student’s own classroom practices. This bond may be especially important because the social and emotional experiences upon entering student teaching are often unexpected by the student teacher. Their selfview as teachers change due to the “reality shock” (Caires et al., 2010). Their high self-expectations and belief that “they know and control all the facets of the profession and of the school ethos” (Fernandez & Erbilgin, 2009, p. 17) are challenged by the realities of the classroom. These changes in self-perception leading to teacher socialization can be attributed to the Sociocultural Theory of Learning (e.g., Vygotsky, 1934/1962). According to the Sociocultural Theory, knowledge about teaching is socially constructed between the learner and the community around them: Preservice teachers are processing ideas, beliefs, and practices from the communities in which they are involved. While at the university, this community consists of faculty, fellow education students, and other university-based inputs. Once in the school classroom, however, the context that the student teacher operates in has changed. Now their community consists primarily of classroom teachers, students, and parents. While the university supervisor bridges these communities, the influence of his or her “voice” within the student teaching community is ambiguous. With the overall goal of investigating whether certain university procedures can increase the influence and effectiveness of the student teaching experience, two intermediate questions became the focus of our study. First, is there a difference Increasing University Supervisor Influence Volume 37, No. 1 • Spring, 2013 between student teachers who had previously taken a class with their university supervisor compared to those who had not in regard to the student-teacher relationship; willingness to take advice; likelihood of the using university-taught methods; and overall perception of the university supervisor’s knowledge of pedagogy, content, and the “real” classroom? Second, is there a correlation between student teachers’ relationships with their university supervisors and their likelihood of using university-taught methods in their classrooms, accepting their university supervisors’ advice, and valuing their university supervisors’ knowledge? These two questions taken together show how the relationship between supervisors and student teachers affects the transfer of learning from university to school classroom and thus shed light on the effectiveness and influence of university supervisors. 
Researchers	Across the nation, educators continue to face challenges as they work to individualize instruction to meet the specific needs of their students. However, theory suggests that teachers who possess a clear vision for teaching creatively weave their personal convictions for teaching with instructional practices. Drawing upon a teacher’s (first author) account of her vision and the classroom literacy practices structured over the course of one year, a practical approach is taken to address teacher visioning as a way to sustain teachers’ creativity despite the pressures associated with teaching in today’s educational climate. Recent educational reform efforts (see Race to the Top, 2009) continue to pressure educators to teach according to standardized curricula despite the fact that such efforts have been proven to fail many of the nation’s students (Good, 2011). In contrast, scholars contend that by following one’s vision, teachers may be able to “speak back” to institutional directives and therefore more easily meet the individual needs of their students (Achinstein & Ogawa, 2006; Duffy; 2002; Hammerness, 2003; 2006; Vaughn & Faircloth, 2011). By creating a vision for teaching, educators are able to craft an “ideal image” of what it is they wish to accomplish in their classrooms and use this to sustain them throughout their teaching career (Hammerness, 2006). Teachers who enact a clear vision are often able to “adjust, modify, and invent” (Duffy, 2002, p. 333) as they use their vision to guide their work. Much like “a mirror… teachers [use] their vision and recognize successes as well as identifying areas for improvement” (p. 3). Gambrell and her colleagues (2011) support this claim as they suggest that “without a vision the teacher is left to sway and sputter as a candle facing the winds of curricular change and federal, district, and school level impositions” (p. 18). A teacher’s vision is therefore, arguably, an essential tool in classrooms today. Like many educators across the nation, I (first author) was frustrated with my district and my principal’s efforts to enforce prescribed educational policies that did not fit the individual needs of my students. I conducted this self-study research project as a way to explore my vision for teaching, the way it was enacted, and to understand the relationship between these foundational variables and my students’ literacy experiences. At the time of the study, I was a beginning doctoral candidate at a university in the southeastern part of the United States. This study began as a course assignment and was then extended to further examine how I worked to enact my vision despite teaching in a restrictive climate. The research questions guiding this study include: 1. What were the salient dimensions of my vision? 2. How were classroom activities structured to meet this vision? 3. In what ways did my students experience literacy (both their practices and their responses) as my vision was enacted? In this article, I share my reflections about my teaching over the course of one year and focus on the ways in which I negotiated my vision for teaching literacy within the curriculum, as well as the ways in which my students participated in these literacy activities. Although I taught in a school that recommended scripted curricula, I adapted and modified the curriculum based on my vision to meet the individual needs of my students. I provide insight into my understandings about my teaching practice and suggest that through doing research of one’s classroom practice, educators may sustain their vision and continue to grow. Related Literature Many scholars have noted the ways in which prescriptive literacy programs restrict teacher autonomy and creativity (Dooley & Assaf, 2009; Pearson, Raphael, Benson & Madda, 2007; Vaughn & Parsons, 2012). Although such prescriptive measures have served to limit teachers’ instructional decisions, the impact on student achievement has also generated a dismal picture. Results from the U.S. Department of Education’s National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) found that during the time federally approved prescriptive literacy programs flooded the nation, the achievement gap in reading grew wider from the start of kindergarten in fall 1998 to the end of 3rd grade in spring 2002. More recently, according to the 2011 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), the average fourth grade and eighth grade reading scores remained unchanged from 2009 scores. Such results suggest that despite federal mandates to increase student achievement in literacy, the efforts have not produced significant gains. In contrast, scholars theorize that teacher visioning may be a way to empower educators, giving them a voice against institutional directives that have limited teachers’ instructional decisions (Duffy, 2005; Hammerness, 2008; Vaughn, 2013). These studies suggest that as teachers use their vision to make decisions, they work to provide instruction they believe best fit the individual needs of their students, classrooms, and school community. According to Hammerness (2006), visions “…can help reveal how teachers conceive of their subjects and their students and how much they pay attention to each” (p. 6). Taken together, visioning suggests a viable tool to empower today’s educators to teach according to their personal convictions and beliefs of what works best for their students. Researchers have begun to examine how even very young students participate in reading activities during teacher-led literacy activities, often examining how students perform during such activities (Davis, 2007; Sipe, 2000). Toth, Dobo-Tarai, and Revak-Moarkoczi (2007) found that first graders provided detailed knowledge of complex concepts when interviewed of their understandings. Similarly, Dyson (1997), in her important work with young kindergarten students, found that young readers and writers described detailed stories about their out-of-school lives and provided clear understandings and beliefs about literacy. Building from this, the current study explored first graders’ reactions to literacy instruction through the use of interviews and observations as a way to fully explore their engagement in and reaction to literacy activities and to contextualize my vision within the classroom. Like many educators, while I had confidence in my vision, my vision was at odds with my school’s recommendations. At the time, my colleagues and I were strongly encouraged to use the same scripted literacy program and to level students according to designated labels (high, medium, and low) in an effort to send them to different classrooms for ability-based reading instruction. The school claimed this practice was grounded in research and would increase students’ test scores on the state-mandated Developmental Reading Assessments (DRA; Beaver, 2006) that were given to first graders. I argued against this practice because I was opposed to labeling students as low, medium, and high. Based on my teaching experiences, such designations lowered students’ confidence, turning reading into a competitive activity, and it appeared to create barriers for students. Students seemed to live up to that expectation, often believing that reading was not something they could or should do. Additionally, teachers in grades kindergarten through second grade were pulled from their classrooms in the spring to conduct test preparation with the third through fifth grades. The administration suggested these grades needed remedial support to pass the state’s assessments. Because of this, K–2 teachers were pulled each day over the course of 3 weeks, during their literacy block, to conduct small-group “skills and drills” lessons with upper elementary students. This testing blitz sent a message to K–2 that high-stakes testing was perhaps more important than the literacy instruction in the lower grades. During this time, teaching assistants were asked to conduct literacy instruction. Additionally, I was opposed to this practice because believed that a “skills and drills” approach was not providing students with the necessary support they needed. Moreover, this approach to teaching was very distant from instructional practices I believed fit with my vision. As such, the emphasis on testing and teaching using this approach proved to be an obstacle that conflicted with my vision for teaching. In contrast, I wanted students to develop at their individual pace while participating in the literacy curriculum. Thus, I did not use the scripted curriculum program recommended by my principal and used by my colleagues. In doing so, this brought conflict, but I worked to develop instruction to meet my vision. 
Researchers	As teacher educators, we explored the impact of a range of teaching approaches to encourage the development of critically reflective thinking (CRT) in teacher candidates. Our study, the second in a series of three investigations, examined differences in two preservice secondary teachers’ responses to CRT as part of a teacher licensure program. We discuss the influence of content area conventions and views on curriculum when preservice teachers are exposed to tools that promote CRT. Our study includes data analyses of the experiences of preservice teachers’ work in urban student-teaching classrooms, along with the university coursework in a teacher preparation program. Our research questions examine the perspectives of two preservice teachers and address the following: On completion of a year-long teacher preparation program focused on encouraging CRT, what are the differences between two preservice teachers in their critically reflective thinking as evidenced by their reflections on teaching? In what ways do the perspectives differ between two content area teachers? And after a first year of teaching, what are these same teachers’ CRT perspectives? Our study is designed to produce usable knowledge—that is, findings that other teacher educators should consider in the design and implementation of field-based experiences and curriculum development for preservice teachers working with diverse student populations. Theoretical Framework Students’ success in school hinges in part on the teachers’ views of children’s language, race, gender, and socioeconomic status (Comber & Simpson, 2001). These differences may, for teachers newly faced with a diverse group of students, evoke notions of deficit or deficiency (Milner, 2008). If teachers adopt deficit views of students’ cultures and languages, they strive to “fix” students they see as the “problem,” rather than the curriculum, society, or school policies that result in segregated classrooms and exclusion from success in school (Banks, 2002; Hollins & Guzman, 2005; Sleeter & Grant, 1999). Likewise, deficit thinking adopts a “blame the victim” stance that can prevent students in urban contexts from reaching their full potential, as teachers may not adequately challenge students of diversity (Milner, 2008; 2010). In this study, CRT is explored to examine the impact of pedagogical and field-based practices that challenge deficit thinking, and to question assumptions. Mary Burbank, Laurie Ramirez, & Alisa Bates The Professional Educator While CRT typically prompts examinations of how teachers reflect on question identification and their understandings for problem solving, researchers have conceptualized CRT in a variety of ways (Loughran, 2002; Rodgers, 2002; Shandomo, 2010). Similar to what some researchers call “critical reflection,” CRT involves problem identification or framing, reflection on the basis of that identification (perhaps historical, social, or cultural in nature), and action planning to address the perceived problem (Brookfield, 1995; Shandomo, 2010). The CRT process is complex in nature, requiring introspection about how one’s beliefs, assumptions, and experiences influence perceptions of self and the social world (Shandomo, 2010). Many preservice teachers enter their education programs with unexamined beliefs and assumptions of students, as well as problematic conceptions of the role of schools in society; yet it is imperative that educators develop stances that allow them to view “problems” from multiple perspectives and actively question assumptions, routines, practices, and standing explanations that are taken for granted (Carrington & Selva, 2010; Loughran, 2002). That is, teacher educators must help preservice teachers identify why a problem exists and examine the factors that have influenced its identification. Like problem framing, seeking solutions requires a reflective process from educators that extends beyond strategy implementation. Educators must consider the factors that influence why problems occur, examine why problems are identified as significant, and develop strategies for responding that reflect an open-mindedness that is informed both by other educators and theories of practice (Dewey, 1933). The intensity and mindfulness of reflective thinking extends beyond problem solving in terms of depth and focus (Dewey, 1933), requiring what Larrivee (2008) suggests is a complete paradigm shift from “viewing problems as needing to be dealt with to seeing them as opportunities for self-reflection and the emergence of new possibilities” (p. 101). Van Manen (1977) defined critical reflection as using criteria of justice and equity to consider the political, moral, and ethical consequences of teaching practice. Larrivee (2008) similarly suggests that critical reflection is an opportunity for teachers to “reflect on the moral and ethical implications and consequences of their classroom practices” (p. 90), a process that requires examination of how one’s personal and professional belief systems might impact students and their learning For teacher educators, efforts intended to promote critically reflective practice have been limited in terms of the impact on teachers’ thinking. For example, case analyses and discussions, reflective journaling, and action research provide tools for staging reflective thought (Carrington & Selva, 2010; Gore & Zeichner, 1991; cf. Harrington, Quinn-Leering, & Hodson, 1996; Leland, Harste, & Youssef, 1997; cf. Moje & Wade, 1997; Nolan, 2008; Risko, Roskos, & Vukelich, 1999; Wade, Fauske, & Thompson, 2008). However, findings have indicated that the degree to which reflective thinking takes place by teachers is often limited. Like others, we assumed a combination of approaches to teaching critically reflective thinking in connection with field experiences would provide support for the development of CRT and teaching practices. We hoped adopting a contextual approach would enable our preservice teachers to engage in CRT in meaningful ways by connecting coursework and fieldwork (Shandomo, 2010). Specifically, we included opportunities for problem-framing activities, critical analyses of literature through inperson and online discussions using scenario prompts, and investigations into real-world teaching experiences coupled with action research projects. Critically Reflective Thinking in Urban Teacher Education Volume 36, No. 2 • Fall, 2012 Teacher Development and CRT The implementation of CRT and the manifestations of practice within teacher education programs is not a simple effort infused with fool-proof strategies or tools. An historical review of curricular and field-based trends in teacher education illustrates how attention to how crucial reflection on topics such as diversity and multiculturalism have developed in nuanced ways over time, reflecting changes in content and course-related experiences (Castro, 2010). While these developmental dimensions of program changes document the evolution of depth in program delivery, focus, and intent, the outcomes for preservice teachers in their daily practices have varied considerably. In his article on analyses of documented research on approaches to increasing preservice teachers’ understandings of cultural diversity in teacher education during the past 30 years, Castro delineates the success with which programs have addressed student teachers’ engagement and understanding of cultural diversity. This in-depth review of previous research challenges teacher educators to consider how various program-based pedagogies, curricula, and field experience move teacher thinking beyond more superficial understandings of diversity. While an increased awareness of the complexity of multicultural understandings have been fostered among preservice teachers through a range of efforts, the results for most preservice teachers have been rather narrow (Castro, 2010). Although iterations in course- and field-based experiences that included direct work within communities, personal reflections, and examinations of beliefs and backgrounds have been infused within teacher education programs over time, the impact has not been significant. More substantive change has occurred, however, within programs that tap into what Castro describes as a greater awareness of and acceptance of diverse communities. He cites these changes in groups he identifies as among the “millennial” generation of students. He reports that while this group tends to be more interactive and engaged within diverse communities, deep understandings of diversity are still quite limited. In addition to maintaining relatively simplistic views of diversity, analyses of these research findings indicate a lack of critical consciousness regarding fundamental beliefs about diversity. Some might argue that more superficial beliefs and teaching practices among preservice teachers are simply a feature of teacher development (Dreyfus & Dreyfus, 1986; Zeichner, 1992). That is, teacher development takes place along a continuum where the early stages of learning to teach are often based upon gaining general knowledge about teachers’ work (Ball & Cohen, 1999; Putnam & Borko, 2000; Rosenholtz, 1989). With time, researchers argue, the “sensemaking” (Coburn, 2001; 2004) takes place among educators based upon interactions between the knowledge about teaching and the knowledge gained through experience. A give-and-take between these levels of knowledge is refined over time into the praxis within a teacher’s repertoire. In addition, to influence of general growth in learning to teach, others argue that the conventions of content areas may also lead teachers to adopt teaching practices and beliefs about student learning that align with more commonplace practices in their content areas regarding the ways in which curriculum and instruction are typically approached, ultimately socializing teacher behaviors in K–12 classrooms (Gossman, 2008; Neumann, Parry, & Becher, 2002). Our study is designed to foster a greater understanding of the impact of critical reflective teaching for two content area teachers, with an examination of similarities and differences regarding their perspectives on teaching as it relates to diversity. We address direct efforts using critical reflective Mary Burbank, Laurie Ramirez, & Alisa Bates The Professional Educator teaching designed to move beliefs and attitudes to the more advanced developmental levels cited by Castro (2010). The literature is replete with arguments for practices in teacher education that examine issues of power, privilege, and multicultural awareness (Sleeter, 2001; Thompson, 2003). Current research advances teacher educators’ understandings of diversity through examinations of content area preparation that explore social justice and equity in ways that are explicit and defined (Adair, 2008). Through emphases that embed critically reflective thinking and practice within content area discussions, our study examines the underpinnings of content area curriculum and traditional student– teacher roles and their impact on teachers’ daily activities. Without deliberate efforts to broaden our understanding of the influence of content area conventions on curricular and instructional decision making, efforts to address equity and access through CRT become generic, superficial, and predictably formulaic. We explore how content area preparation informs CRT, including teachers’ receptivity and their ability to implement CRT, highlighting the influence of content area curriculum and instruction on CRT thinking. 
Researchers	Within the realm of K–12 education, instability is an inherent feature that school leaders must successfully manage. Turbulence, in the form of micro-level issues (day-to-day, in-house happenings) and macro-level concerns (externally imposed organizational disturbances/changes), develops indiscriminately and may escalate quickly without adequate warning. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the means by which a school leader can moderate the school atmosphere. This paper reveals the decisions, devices, and behaviors of one school principal who worked to minimize the effects of turbulent conditions in the senior high school setting. The findings illuminate particular leadership tools and actions that may be of assistance to school leaders who seek to better stabilize their schools. Introduction Turbulence is an inherent feature of the public school and is something that school leaders must successfully manage. As Gross (1998) explained, there are many sources of turbulence that may arise, including a disjointed community, isolation, issue overload, tension-filled conditions, loss of support, communication problems, rapid changes, value-conflicts, and external pressures. According to Gross’s (2006) turbulence theory, the concept of positionality is important, since where a person stands in relation to the turbulence will determine how he or she experiences it. This is because turbulence “is not usually spread around the school and community in a uniform way” (Gross, 2006, p. 56), and the school principal’s position lends to a preoccupation with many of the conflicts that develop within the organization. Unfortunately, such conflicts may cluster at any given time, and these combined forces or events may become formidable, as they create a cascading effect that escalates the level of turbulence that the school faces (Gross, 2006; Shapiro & Gross, 2013). For the school leader, the cascading effect is something that is often very real and may require a high capacity for management, decision-making, and action. Furthermore, the school leader must consider when to deliberately heighten the level of turbulence within the organization, for the purpose of gaining positive results in pursuing particular goals (Shapiro & Gross, 2013). Along with the school principal’s role and expertise in handling turbulence, the school’s stability will determine whether it can withstand heightened levels of turbulence. The school’s stability level depends on past and present circumstances, members’ confidence in the inherent worthiness of the organization, and the school’s ability to be flexible while turning turbulent experiences into opportunities (Gross & Shapiro, 2013). Purpose of the Study The purpose of this study was to examine the workings of a school principal who sought to manage turbulence within the senior high school environment. The study explores the lived experiences of the Edward L. Myers The Professional Educator leader, subordinates, and stakeholders who were involved with the school organization. The focus is on gaining an understanding of the school principal’s intentions, and then examining his actual leadership decisions and behaviors, as experienced by school stakeholders. Specifically, this study seeks to reveal whether the school principal was able to successfully lead the school organization during times of heightened turbulence, and to determine what allowed or disallowed him to do so. The perceptions of administrators, teachers, staff, parents, community members, and recent graduates were utilized to gather an understanding of the principal’s leadership behavior. This process was set to generate an understanding of how leader competencies and organizational behavior relate to the management of turbulence within the school environment. A Primer on Turbulence within the School Organization Putnam (1991) revealed that, “within any environment, there are areas of calm, agitation, opportunity, and danger – as well as areas of unknown risks. Because of these coexisting but conflicting elements, all environments are turbulent” (pp. 1–2). As an aggregate of uninhibited forces arise, the degree of instability increases (Putnam, 1991). However, with the right decisions, skills, and actions, a school can appropriately harness turbulence within the organizational environment (Gross, 2006; Putnam, 1991; Shapiro & Gross, 2013). Intertwined with turbulence is the concept of change, which is fundamental to school leadership in the 21st century. According to Fullan (2009), school principals have the difficult task of managing two different worlds: The old world is still around, with expectations that the principal will run a smooth school and to be responsive to all; simultaneously, the new world rains down on schools with disconnected demands, expecting that at the end of the day the school constantly should be showing better test results and ideally becoming a learning organization. (p. 57) With this “double world” comes the paradox effect, which, as Jaffee (2001) discusses, “stems from the multiple consequences of a single action which seem to contradict or work at cross-purposes with another” (p. 34). Even with the best of intentions, the actions of a school principal within such a world create a natural tension, as both positive and negative organizational effects occur (Jaffee, 2001). More than two decades ago, Morgan (1988) accurately predicted the 21st century management world, which consists of tension, ambiguity, and paradox, and proposed that managers must cope with chaotic, ambiguous situations through creative actions and solutions. Morgan also explained the necessity for managers to understand that complexity is innate to the leadership game: Many managers may want simplicity, but the reality is that they have to deal with complexity. The complexity of organizational life is increasing rather than decreasing, as manifested in the conflicting demands posed by multiple stakeholders, the need for managers to deal with many things at once, and the almost continuous state of transition in which organizations exist. (p. 12) Quite possibly, the school organization stands as the most appropriate venue for Morgan’s thinking. This is due to the multiplicity of issues and concerns that need to be addressed within the educational domain (Beck, 1994; Blankstein, 2004; Gross, 1998; Sernak, 1998; Shapiro & Gross, 2013). Taming Turbulence Volume 38, No. 2  Fall, 2014 Fullan (2009) outlines various forces of turbulence, fragmentation, and change that mark today’s typical educational institution, including a lack of coherence in mission; disconnections within the school curriculum; incomplete and/or insufficient teaching modalities; student alienation and strained relationships; an anti-intellectual peer culture; and a lack of student support and attention due to large, overcrowded schools (p. 42). While high levels of turbulence are very real within today’s K–12 school system, Sergiovanni (2005) argues that, with the right mix of values, systems, structures, and actions, school leaders hold the capacity to successfully defend against the obstacles they face as they work to improve their respective schools. From this perspective, various authors have offered their views on how to best manage the forces of turbulence, change, and paradox within school organizations (Fullan, 2010; Kochanek, 2005; MacGilchrist, Myers, & Reed, 2004; O’Donoghue & Clarke, 2010; Schlechty, 2005). In fact, various conceptual ingredients have been offered for managing, leading, and improving school organizations in turbulent times. Included in the mix are such terms as networked organizations, distributed leadership, professional learning communities, ethical decision-making practices, operational intelligence, collective capacities, teacher leadership, and systemic vision (Fullan, 2009; Gabriel, 2005; Kochanek, 2005; Lambert, 2003; Lunenburg & Irby, 2006; MacGilchrist, Myers, & Reed, 2004; O’Donoghue & Clarke, 2010; Strike, 2007). While some of these focus on the decisions and actions of the school leader, others center on more global organizational behavior. In light of the modalities school leaders currently have available to them during turbulent times, there is an urgent call to microscopically study the actualities of school leadership practice in today’s schools. This is due to the sociopolitical conditions that have made turbulence and change very real to the educational arena in the 21st century. To better understand the attributes, proficiencies, and limitations of school leadership practice, it is necessary to analyze the activity that plays out in K–12 public school settings. By doing so, scholars and practitioners can better understand what is being done to combat the turbulent forces currently disrupting the educational process. In turn, school leaders, scholars, and practitioners can learn lessons in educational leadership through real-world scenarios. 
Researchers	School systems have access to more data than ever before, but most teachers and school leaders lack the skills to use the data for student and school improvement. Current attempts to use data have lacked depth and have been more focused on accountability and meeting state and federal requirements than on systematically investigating the factors that support and hinder the teaching and learning process. As a result, the potential benefits of data usage have not been realized. This commentary examines the critical issues facing school leaders concerning data-informed decision-making based on existing research and firsthand experience working with school principals. Individuals in many professions routinely use data as a basis for assessing progress and making quality decisions. For example, data play an essential role in medical diagnosis and treatment, engineering, and automobile manufacturing. Educators often report that we cannot rely on data to solve the challenges students face in the learning process, because in fact students are too complex (Wayman & Stringfield, 2006). I acknowledge the complexity of the teaching and learning process, but I maintain that using data appropriately can inform and improve the process. Of course, in the age of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB), the phrase “data-informed decision-making” has become part of the lexicon of the American educator. The importance of using data is now taken for granted as an essential component of any educational improvement process. School district superintendents consistently report data use as the most important strategy for addressing NCLB, state accountability systems, and the constant pressure to improve student achievement (Coburn & Talbert, 2006; Means, 2009). The use of data as a tool to drive school improvement is not a new phenomenon. Earlier reform movements, such as A Nation at Risk in the 1980s (Gordon, 2006) and Goals 2000 in the 1990s (Zhao, 2009), also stressed the importance of using data in making educational decisions and assessing educational progress. However, due to both technological advances and the mandates of NCLB, there is more data available now than ever before, and the emphasis placed on data has grown. One particular type of data, student achievement data in the form of high-stakes standardized tests, has become particularly important. While multiple measures are advocated, student achievement scores remain a primary indicator of student, teacher, principal, school, and district effectiveness (Cravens, Chen, Porter, Elliott, & Carson, 2009; John Murray The Professional Educator Leigh, 2010). Furthermore, student performance on standardized tests also influences real estate values and the overall vitality of a community (Nguyen-Hoang & Yinger, 2011). The use of data, particularly if only one type is being used, is not a panacea for school improvement. As Means’ (2009) national study found, school systems have access to more data than ever before, but most teachers and school leaders lack the skills to use the data for student and school improvement. Current attempts to use data have lacked depth and have been more focused on accountability and meeting state and federal requirements than on systematically investigating the factors that support and hinder the teaching and learning process. As a result, the potential benefits of data usage have not been realized. We know that teachers, school leadership, curriculum, and community involvement all influence student learning. Properly utilized, data can help educators better understand how these dimensions influence student achievement in a particular context. Multiple types of data should be used, and data should become a mechanism to connect student performance with curriculum, instruction, remediation, acceleration, teacher professional development, and the allocation of fiscal and human resources for school and district improvement (Campbell & Levin, 2009). A body of research is emerging on data use in schools. Much of the research to date has dealt with specific areas of schools, such as teachers (Lachat & Smith, 2005; Schildkamp & Kuiper, 2010), principals (Supovitz & Klein, 2003; Wayman, Cho, & Johnston, 2007), and the central office (Honig & Coburn, 2008; Moll, 2009). Additionally, a growing research base is available to help teachers understand educational data use systemically. Scholars are examining ways to use data to align, integrate, and support various components of a school district so that the entire district is a more coherent, data-using organization. Knowledge from these studies suggests that integrated, districtwide data use can be better accomplished by aligning vision, practice, and data (Supovitz & Klein, 2003; Wohlstetter, Datnow, & Park, 2008), focusing on leadership at multiple levels (Halverson, Prichett, Grigg, & Thomas, 2005; Mandinach, Honey, Light, & Brunner, 2008), efficiently integrating technology (Wayman, Conoly, Gasko, & Stringfield, 2008), and emphasizing professional development (Datnow, Park, & Wohlstetter, 2007). Still, there is much to learn about how school districts may make better use of data. For example, we still need to determine the essential components involved in school leaders efficiently and effectively accessing, generating, managing, interpreting, and acting on data. In this commentary, I examine the critical issues facing school leaders concerning data-informed decision-making based on existing research and my experience working with principals, central office personnel, and state department of education personnel in a southeast state. Clarifying the Role of Data The presence of common understandings about educational goals and practices is an important aspect of organizational improvement. The function and role of data in the school improvement process is often poorly defined, leading schools and school leaders to be confused about how and when to use specific types of data. As Wayman and Springfield Critical Issues Facing School Leaders Volume 38, No. 1 • Spring, 2014 (2006) have argued, a common understanding of the role of data is critical if it is to be used to improve schools and student achievement. There are several important elements involved in clarifying the role of data. It is first important to be clear about whether decisions will be data-driven, data-based, or datainformed. I support the argument advanced by Shen and Cooley (2008) that data should inform rather than drive decisions. Data can serve as an important element in effective decision-making, but educators should not entirely base their decisions on data. Education is a human enterprise involving children, and data fail to give educators all of the information they need to help children learn. Second, it is important to take a systemic, continuous improvement approach to data analysis. Educators should gather and analyze data to gain a better understanding of the system that is producing the current results in a school or district. Then they can use the data to continuously improve the system and, ultimately, enhance student learning. By “system” I mean all the processes and procedures that influence student learning. Systems thinking (Senge, Cambron-McCabe, Lucas, & Kleiner, 2000) is about viewing the whole and the interrelationships of the parts of the whole to each other. From a systems thinking perspective, most differences in student performance are due to the system, not the individual student. In other words, it is important to look not only at the material presented but also the ways in which it is presented. Third, data collection and analysis must be firmly connected to guiding questions posed and answered by teachers and other school leaders. Teachers and other school leaders must specify what they want to know about their school and students, and must know why the information is needed. In addition, they must determine what types of data they need to answer their questions. By keeping the focus on guiding questions developed and answered by school staff and administrators, data collection and analysis has a clear purpose. After all, “data, alone, are not evidence of anything until users of the data bring concepts, criteria, theories of action, and interpretive frames of reference to the task of making sense of the data” (Knapp, Swinnerton, & Copland, 2006, p. 10). Several studies have confirmed that when school staff work together to develop guiding questions and select data collection approaches, they have a better understanding of the role of data, and they remain more focused on the connection of different types of data to student achievement (Langley, Moen, Nolan, Nolan, Norman, & Provost, 2009; Wayman, Cho, & Richards, 2010).
